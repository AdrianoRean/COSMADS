q0,0,Give me the serial number of camera 1 and camera 2 of all the diecutters in the factory.,"brief_description: Data service that, given the id of a camera1, provides a frame captured from that camera1. - detailed_description: Data service that, given the id of a camera1, provides a frame captured from that camera1.
        In general instances of camera1 point downwards to a conveyor belt of a specific production line that trasports single cutout cardboards produced by a specific diecutter.
        The data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the camera1 (an integer) and returns a frame captured from that camera1 as a numpy matrix.
        The matrix is a 2D array having a shape of (1080, 1920, 3) where 1080 is the height, 1920 is the width and 3 is the number of channels (RGB).

        Example usage:
        - If the id of the camera1 is 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        camera1_id = 123
        frame = GetFrameFromCamera1.call(camera1_id=123)
        # assuming the frame is a numpy matrix
        print(frame.shape)  # (1080, 1920, 3)

        Things to keep in mind:
        - The refresh rate of the camera is 1 second, i.e. the frame is updated every second, so if the data service is called multiple times within a second, it will return the same value.
        - The frame is a numpy matrix, so avoid trying to access it as a dictionary. - input_parameters: ['camera1_id:int'] - output_values: ['frame:np.matrix'] - module: camera1 - class_name: GetFrameFromCamera1brief_description: Data service that, given a frame captured from a specific camera1 and the identifier of that camera1, detects whether the frame contains a cardboard with errors and provide the type of error. - detailed_description: Data service that, given a frame captured from a specific camera1 and the identifier of that camera1, detects whether the frame contains a cardboard with errors.
        Recall that a camera1 is a camera device that points downwards to a conveyor belt of a specific production line that trasports single cutout cardboards produced by a specific diecutter.
        It takes two parameters, the id of the camera1 to use and the frame captured from that camera1.
        It returns a boolean value, True if the frame contains a cardboard with errors, False otherwise.
        Also it returns a integer value, 0 if the frame does not contain errors, 1 if the errors are of type hole and 2 if the errors are of type fold. 

        Example usage:
        - If frame is a variable containing the frame captured from the camera1 with id 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        camera1_id = 123
        contains_errors, type_errors = DetectErrorsInCardboardUsingCamera1.call(camera1_id=123, frame=frame)

        Things to keep in mind:
        - The output is a tuple of boolean and integer, so avoid trying to access it as a dictionary. - input_parameters: ['camera1_id:int', 'frame:np.matrix'] - output_values: ['contains_errors:bool', 'error_type:int'] - module: camera1 - class_name: DetectErrorsInCardboardUsingCamera1brief_description: Data service that, given the id of a camera2, provides a frame captured from that camera2. - detailed_description: Data service that, given the id of a camera2, provides a frame captured from that camera2.
        Recall that a camera2 is a camera device that points downwards to a conveyor belt of a specific production line that trasports stack of cutout cardboards produced by a specific diecutter.
        The data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the camera2 (an integer) and returns a frame captured from that camera2 as a numpy matrix.
        The matrix is a 2D array having a shape of (1080, 1920, 3) where 1080 is the height, 1920 is the width and 3 is the number of channels (RGB).

        Example usage:
        - If the id of the camera2 is 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        camera2_id = 123
        frame = GetFrameFromCamera2.call(camera2_id=123)
        # assuming the frame is a numpy matrix

        The data service relies on the management database of the cardboard factory to provide the list of diecutter id.
        The data service takes no parameter and returns a list of integers, which are the id of the diecutters installed in the factory.

        Example usage:
        - The data service would be called as follows:

        In general each diecutter has exactly one chip embedded into it, and each chip is uniquely identified by an integer id. 
        This means that the chip id has a one-to-one correspondence with the id of the diecutter, but those two ids may not be the same.
        This data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the chip (an integer) and returns a single dictionary containing the current speed, temperature and number of rotations of the diecutter it is attached to.
        The keys of the dictionary are ""speed"", ""temperature"" and ""rotations"". 
        
        Example usage:
        - If the id of the chip is 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        chip_id = 123
        current_data = GetCurrentData.call(chip_id=123)
        # get the current speed, temperature and number of rotations
        current_speed = data[""speed""]
        current_temperature = data[""temperature""]
        current_rotations = data[""rotations""]
    
        Things to keep in mind:
        - The refresh rate of the data is 1 second, i.e. the data is updated every second, so if the data service is called multiple times within a second, it will return the same value.
        - Note that the values in the dictionary represents the current values of the speed, etc. of the diecutter, they are not aggregated values.
        - Remember that the output value is a dictionary with the above specified keys, so avoid trying to access it using keys not in the above example. - input_parameters: ['chip_id:int'] - output_values: ['diecutter_current_data:dict'] - module: diecutter - class_name: GetCurrentDataFromChip","from data_services.database import GetDiecutterChipIdFromDiecutterId

q0,1,Provide a list of serial numbers for camera 1 and camera 2 from every diecutter within the factory.,"brief_description: Data service that, given the id of a camera1, provides a frame captured from that camera1. - detailed_description: Data service that, given the id of a camera1, provides a frame captured from that camera1.
        In general instances of camera1 point downwards to a conveyor belt of a specific production line that trasports single cutout cardboards produced by a specific diecutter.
        The data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the camera1 (an integer) and returns a frame captured from that camera1 as a numpy matrix.
        The matrix is a 2D array having a shape of (1080, 1920, 3) where 1080 is the height, 1920 is the width and 3 is the number of channels (RGB).

        Example usage:
        - If the id of the camera1 is 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        camera1_id = 123
        frame = GetFrameFromCamera1.call(camera1_id=123)
        # assuming the frame is a numpy matrix
        print(frame.shape)  # (1080, 1920, 3)

        Things to keep in mind:
        - The refresh rate of the camera is 1 second, i.e. the frame is updated every second, so if the data service is called multiple times within a second, it will return the same value.
        - The frame is a numpy matrix, so avoid trying to access it as a dictionary. - input_parameters: ['camera1_id:int'] - output_values: ['frame:np.matrix'] - module: camera1 - class_name: GetFrameFromCamera1brief_description: Data service that, given a frame captured from a specific camera1 and the identifier of that camera1, detects whether the frame contains a cardboard with errors and provide the type of error. - detailed_description: Data service that, given a frame captured from a specific camera1 and the identifier of that camera1, detects whether the frame contains a cardboard with errors.
        Recall that a camera1 is a camera device that points downwards to a conveyor belt of a specific production line that trasports single cutout cardboards produced by a specific diecutter.
        It takes two parameters, the id of the camera1 to use and the frame captured from that camera1.
        It returns a boolean value, True if the frame contains a cardboard with errors, False otherwise.
        Also it returns a integer value, 0 if the frame does not contain errors, 1 if the errors are of type hole and 2 if the errors are of type fold. 

        Example usage:
        - If frame is a variable containing the frame captured from the camera1 with id 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        camera1_id = 123
        contains_errors, type_errors = DetectErrorsInCardboardUsingCamera1.call(camera1_id=123, frame=frame)

        Things to keep in mind:
        - The output is a tuple of boolean and integer, so avoid trying to access it as a dictionary. - input_parameters: ['camera1_id:int', 'frame:np.matrix'] - output_values: ['contains_errors:bool', 'error_type:int'] - module: camera1 - class_name: DetectErrorsInCardboardUsingCamera1brief_description: Data service that, given the id of a camera2, provides a frame captured from that camera2. - detailed_description: Data service that, given the id of a camera2, provides a frame captured from that camera2.
        Recall that a camera2 is a camera device that points downwards to a conveyor belt of a specific production line that trasports stack of cutout cardboards produced by a specific diecutter.
        The data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the camera2 (an integer) and returns a frame captured from that camera2 as a numpy matrix.
        The matrix is a 2D array having a shape of (1080, 1920, 3) where 1080 is the height, 1920 is the width and 3 is the number of channels (RGB).

        camera2_id = 123
        frame = GetFrameFromCamera2.call(camera2_id=123)

        In general each diecutter has exactly one chip embedded into it, and each chip is uniquely identified by an integer id. 
        This means that the chip id has a one-to-one correspondence with the id of the diecutter, but those two ids may not be the same.
        This data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the chip (an integer) and returns a single dictionary containing the current speed, temperature and number of rotations of the diecutter it is attached to.
        The keys of the dictionary are ""speed"", ""temperature"" and ""rotations"". 
        
        Example usage:
        - If the id of the chip is 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        chip_id = 123
        current_data = GetCurrentData.call(chip_id=123)
        # get the current speed, temperature and number of rotations
        current_speed = data[""speed""]
        current_temperature = data[""temperature""]
        current_rotations = data[""rotations""]
    
        Things to keep in mind:
        - The refresh rate of the data is 1 second, i.e. the data is updated every second, so if the data service is called multiple times within a second, it will return the same value.
        - Note that the values in the dictionary represents the current values of the speed, etc. of the diecutter, they are not aggregated values.
        - Remember that the output value is a dictionary with the above specified keys, so avoid trying to access it using keys not in the above example. - input_parameters: ['chip_id:int'] - output_values: ['diecutter_current_data:dict'] - module: diecutter - class_name: GetCurrentDataFromChip","from data_services.database import GetDiecutterChipIdFromDiecutterId

q0,2,Provide the serial numbers for camera 1 and camera 2 from every diecutter within the factory.,"brief_description: Data service that, given the id of a camera1, provides a frame captured from that camera1. - detailed_description: Data service that, given the id of a camera1, provides a frame captured from that camera1.
        In general instances of camera1 point downwards to a conveyor belt of a specific production line that trasports single cutout cardboards produced by a specific diecutter.
        The data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the camera1 (an integer) and returns a frame captured from that camera1 as a numpy matrix.
        The matrix is a 2D array having a shape of (1080, 1920, 3) where 1080 is the height, 1920 is the width and 3 is the number of channels (RGB).

        Example usage:
        - If the id of the camera1 is 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        camera1_id = 123
        frame = GetFrameFromCamera1.call(camera1_id=123)
        # assuming the frame is a numpy matrix
        print(frame.shape)  # (1080, 1920, 3)

        Things to keep in mind:
        - The refresh rate of the camera is 1 second, i.e. the frame is updated every second, so if the data service is called multiple times within a second, it will return the same value.
        - The frame is a numpy matrix, so avoid trying to access it as a dictionary. - input_parameters: ['camera1_id:int'] - output_values: ['frame:np.matrix'] - module: camera1 - class_name: GetFrameFromCamera1brief_description: Data service that, given a frame captured from a specific camera1 and the identifier of that camera1, detects whether the frame contains a cardboard with errors and provide the type of error. - detailed_description: Data service that, given a frame captured from a specific camera1 and the identifier of that camera1, detects whether the frame contains a cardboard with errors.
        Recall that a camera1 is a camera device that points downwards to a conveyor belt of a specific production line that trasports single cutout cardboards produced by a specific diecutter.
        It takes two parameters, the id of the camera1 to use and the frame captured from that camera1.
        It returns a boolean value, True if the frame contains a cardboard with errors, False otherwise.
        Also it returns a integer value, 0 if the frame does not contain errors, 1 if the errors are of type hole and 2 if the errors are of type fold. 

        Example usage:
        - If frame is a variable containing the frame captured from the camera1 with id 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        camera1_id = 123
        contains_errors, type_errors = DetectErrorsInCardboardUsingCamera1.call(camera1_id=123, frame=frame)

        Things to keep in mind:
        - The output is a tuple of boolean and integer, so avoid trying to access it as a dictionary. - input_parameters: ['camera1_id:int', 'frame:np.matrix'] - output_values: ['contains_errors:bool', 'error_type:int'] - module: camera1 - class_name: DetectErrorsInCardboardUsingCamera1brief_description: Data service that, given the id of a camera2, provides a frame captured from that camera2. - detailed_description: Data service that, given the id of a camera2, provides a frame captured from that camera2.
        Recall that a camera2 is a camera device that points downwards to a conveyor belt of a specific production line that trasports stack of cutout cardboards produced by a specific diecutter.
        The data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the camera2 (an integer) and returns a frame captured from that camera2 as a numpy matrix.
        The matrix is a 2D array having a shape of (1080, 1920, 3) where 1080 is the height, 1920 is the width and 3 is the number of channels (RGB).

        camera2_id = 123
        frame = GetFrameFromCamera2.call(camera2_id=123)

        The data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the diecutter (an integer) and returns a single integer, which is the current session id of the diecutter.

        Example usage:
        - If the id of the diecutter is 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        diecutter_id = 123
        session_id = GetCurrentSessionIdFromDiecutterId.call(diecutter_id=123)
        # assuming the session id is 456
        print(session_id)  # 456

        Things to keep in mind:
        - The session id is an integer, so avoid trying to access it as a dictionary. - input_parameters: ['diecutter_id:int'] - output_values: ['session_id:int'] - module: database - class_name: GetCurrentSessionIdFromDiecutterIdbrief_description: Data service that, given a chip id of a chip embedded into a diecutter, provides the current speed, temperature and number of rotations measured by that chip. - detailed_description: Data service that, given a chip id of a chip embedded into a diecutter, provides the current speed, temperature and number of rotations measured by that chip.
        In general each diecutter has exactly one chip embedded into it, and each chip is uniquely identified by an integer id. 
        This means that the chip id has a one-to-one correspondence with the id of the diecutter, but those two ids may not be the same.
        This data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the chip (an integer) and returns a single dictionary containing the current speed, temperature and number of rotations of the diecutter it is attached to.
        The keys of the dictionary are ""speed"", ""temperature"" and ""rotations"". 
        
        Example usage:
        - If the id of the chip is 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        chip_id = 123
        current_data = GetCurrentData.call(chip_id=123)
        # get the current speed, temperature and number of rotations
        current_speed = data[""speed""]
        current_temperature = data[""temperature""]
        current_rotations = data[""rotations""]
    
        Things to keep in mind:
        - The refresh rate of the data is 1 second, i.e. the data is updated every second, so if the data service is called multiple times within a second, it will return the same value.
        - Note that the values in the dictionary represents the current values of the speed, etc. of the diecutter, they are not aggregated values.
        - Remember that the output value is a dictionary with the above specified keys, so avoid trying to access it using keys not in the above example. - input_parameters: ['chip_id:int'] - output_values: ['diecutter_current_data:dict'] - module: diecutter - class_name: GetCurrentDataFromChip","from data_services.database import GetDiecutterChipIdFromDiecutterId

        In general instances of camera1 point downwards to a conveyor belt of a specific production line that trasports single cutout cardboards produced by a specific diecutter.
        The data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the camera1 (an integer) and returns a frame captured from that camera1 as a numpy matrix.
        The matrix is a 2D array having a shape of (1080, 1920, 3) where 1080 is the height, 1920 is the width and 3 is the number of channels (RGB).

        Example usage:
        - If the id of the camera1 is 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        camera1_id = 123

        Things to keep in mind:
        - The refresh rate of the camera is 1 second, i.e. the frame is updated every second, so if the data service is called multiple times within a second, it will return the same value.

        Recall that a camera1 is a camera device that points downwards to a conveyor belt of a specific production line that trasports single cutout cardboards produced by a specific diecutter.
        It takes two parameters, the id of the camera1 to use and the frame captured from that camera1.
        It returns a boolean value, True if the frame contains a cardboard with errors, False otherwise.
        Also it returns a integer value, 0 if the frame does not contain errors, 1 if the errors are of type hole and 2 if the errors are of type fold. 

        Example usage:
        - If frame is a variable containing the frame captured from the camera1 with id 123, then the data service would be called as follows:

        The data service relies on the management database of the cardboard factory to provide the session id.
        The data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the diecutter (an integer) and returns a single integer, which is the current session id of the diecutter.

        Example usage:
        - If the id of the diecutter is 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        diecutter_id = 123
        session_id = GetCurrentSessionIdFromDiecutterId.call(diecutter_id=123)
        # assuming the session id is 456
        print(session_id)  # 456

        Things to keep in mind:
        - The session id is an integer, so avoid trying to access it as a dictionary. - input_parameters: ['diecutter_id:int'] - output_values: ['session_id:int'] - module: database - class_name: GetCurrentSessionIdFromDiecutterIdbrief_description: Data service that, given a chip id of a chip embedded into a diecutter, provides the current speed, temperature and number of rotations measured by that chip. - detailed_description: Data service that, given a chip id of a chip embedded into a diecutter, provides the current speed, temperature and number of rotations measured by that chip.
        In general each diecutter has exactly one chip embedded into it, and each chip is uniquely identified by an integer id. 
        This means that the chip id has a one-to-one correspondence with the id of the diecutter, but those two ids may not be the same.
        This data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the chip (an integer) and returns a single dictionary containing the current speed, temperature and number of rotations of the diecutter it is attached to.
        The keys of the dictionary are ""speed"", ""temperature"" and ""rotations"". 
        
        Example usage:
        - If the id of the chip is 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        chip_id = 123
        current_data = GetCurrentData.call(chip_id=123)
        # get the current speed, temperature and number of rotations
        current_speed = data[""speed""]
        current_temperature = data[""temperature""]
        current_rotations = data[""rotations""]
    
        Things to keep in mind:
        - The refresh rate of the data is 1 second, i.e. the data is updated every second, so if the data service is called multiple times within a second, it will return the same value.
        - Note that the values in the dictionary represents the current values of the speed, etc. of the diecutter, they are not aggregated values.
        - Remember that the output value is a dictionary with the above specified keys, so avoid trying to access it using keys not in the above example. - input_parameters: ['chip_id:int'] - output_values: ['diecutter_current_data:dict'] - module: diecutter - class_name: GetCurrentDataFromChip","from data_services.database import GetDiecutterChipIdFromDiecutterId

q0,4,List the serial numbers for camera 1 and camera 2 associated with each diecutter throughout the factory.,"brief_description: Data service that, given the id of a camera1, provides a frame captured from that camera1. - detailed_description: Data service that, given the id of a camera1, provides a frame captured from that camera1.
        In general instances of camera1 point downwards to a conveyor belt of a specific production line that trasports single cutout cardboards produced by a specific diecutter.
        The data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the camera1 (an integer) and returns a frame captured from that camera1 as a numpy matrix.
        The matrix is a 2D array having a shape of (1080, 1920, 3) where 1080 is the height, 1920 is the width and 3 is the number of channels (RGB).

        Example usage:
        - If the id of the camera1 is 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        camera1_id = 123

        # assuming the frame is a numpy matrix
        print(frame.shape)  # (1080, 1920, 3)

        Things to keep in mind:
        - The refresh rate of the camera is 1 second, i.e. the frame is updated every second, so if the data service is called multiple times within a second, it will return the same value.
        - The frame is a numpy matrix, so avoid trying to access it as a dictionary. - input_parameters: ['camera1_id:int'] - output_values: ['frame:np.matrix'] - module: camera1 - class_name: GetFrameFromCamera1brief_description: Data service that, given a frame captured from a specific camera1 and the identifier of that camera1, detects whether the frame contains a cardboard with errors and provide the type of error. - detailed_description: Data service that, given a frame captured from a specific camera1 and the identifier of that camera1, detects whether the frame contains a cardboard with errors.
        Recall that a camera1 is a camera device that points downwards to a conveyor belt of a specific production line that trasports single cutout cardboards produced by a specific diecutter.
        It takes two parameters, the id of the camera1 to use and the frame captured from that camera1.
        It returns a boolean value, True if the frame contains a cardboard with errors, False otherwise.
        Also it returns a integer value, 0 if the frame does not contain errors, 1 if the errors are of type hole and 2 if the errors are of type fold. 

        Example usage:
        - If frame is a variable containing the frame captured from the camera1 with id 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        camera1_id = 123
        contains_errors, type_errors = DetectErrorsInCardboardUsingCamera1.call(camera1_id=123, frame=frame)

        Things to keep in mind:

        Recall that a camera2 is a camera device that points downwards to a conveyor belt of a specific production line that trasports stack of cutout cardboards produced by a specific diecutter.
        The data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the camera2 (an integer) and returns a frame captured from that camera2 as a numpy matrix.
        The matrix is a 2D array having a shape of (1080, 1920, 3) where 1080 is the height, 1920 is the width and 3 is the number of channels (RGB).

        Example usage:
        - If the id of the camera2 is 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        camera2_id = 123
        frame = GetFrameFromCamera2.call(camera2_id=123)

        The data service relies on the management database of the cardboard factory to provide the list of diecutter id.
        The data service takes no parameter and returns a list of integers, which are the id of the diecutters installed in the factory.

        Example usage:

        In general each diecutter has exactly one chip embedded into it, and each chip is uniquely identified by an integer id. 
        This means that the chip id has a one-to-one correspondence with the id of the diecutter, but those two ids may not be the same.
        This data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the chip (an integer) and returns a single dictionary containing the current speed, temperature and number of rotations of the diecutter it is attached to.
        The keys of the dictionary are ""speed"", ""temperature"" and ""rotations"". 
        
        Example usage:
        - If the id of the chip is 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        chip_id = 123
        current_data = GetCurrentData.call(chip_id=123)
        # get the current speed, temperature and number of rotations
        current_speed = data[""speed""]
        current_temperature = data[""temperature""]
        current_rotations = data[""rotations""]
    
        Things to keep in mind:
        - The refresh rate of the data is 1 second, i.e. the data is updated every second, so if the data service is called multiple times within a second, it will return the same value.
        - Note that the values in the dictionary represents the current values of the speed, etc. of the diecutter, they are not aggregated values.
        - Remember that the output value is a dictionary with the above specified keys, so avoid trying to access it using keys not in the above example. - input_parameters: ['chip_id:int'] - output_values: ['diecutter_current_data:dict'] - module: diecutter - class_name: GetCurrentDataFromChip","from data_services.database import GetDiecutterChipIdFromDiecutterId

q0,5,Provide a list showing the serial numbers for camera 1 and camera 2 associated with every diecutter within the factory.,"brief_description: Data service that, given the id of a camera1, provides a frame captured from that camera1. - detailed_description: Data service that, given the id of a camera1, provides a frame captured from that camera1.
        In general instances of camera1 point downwards to a conveyor belt of a specific production line that trasports single cutout cardboards produced by a specific diecutter.
        The data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the camera1 (an integer) and returns a frame captured from that camera1 as a numpy matrix.
        The matrix is a 2D array having a shape of (1080, 1920, 3) where 1080 is the height, 1920 is the width and 3 is the number of channels (RGB).

        Example usage:
        - If the id of the camera1 is 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        camera1_id = 123
        frame = GetFrameFromCamera1.call(camera1_id=123)
        # assuming the frame is a numpy matrix
        print(frame.shape)  # (1080, 1920, 3)

        Things to keep in mind:
        - The refresh rate of the camera is 1 second, i.e. the frame is updated every second, so if the data service is called multiple times within a second, it will return the same value.
        - The frame is a numpy matrix, so avoid trying to access it as a dictionary. - input_parameters: ['camera1_id:int'] - output_values: ['frame:np.matrix'] - module: camera1 - class_name: GetFrameFromCamera1brief_description: Data service that, given a frame captured from a specific camera1 and the identifier of that camera1, detects whether the frame contains a cardboard with errors and provide the type of error. - detailed_description: Data service that, given a frame captured from a specific camera1 and the identifier of that camera1, detects whether the frame contains a cardboard with errors.
        Recall that a camera1 is a camera device that points downwards to a conveyor belt of a specific production line that trasports single cutout cardboards produced by a specific diecutter.
        It takes two parameters, the id of the camera1 to use and the frame captured from that camera1.
        It returns a boolean value, True if the frame contains a cardboard with errors, False otherwise.
        Also it returns a integer value, 0 if the frame does not contain errors, 1 if the errors are of type hole and 2 if the errors are of type fold. 

        Example usage:
        - If frame is a variable containing the frame captured from the camera1 with id 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        camera1_id = 123
        contains_errors, type_errors = DetectErrorsInCardboardUsingCamera1.call(camera1_id=123, frame=frame)

        Things to keep in mind:
        - The output is a tuple of boolean and integer, so avoid trying to access it as a dictionary. - input_parameters: ['camera1_id:int', 'frame:np.matrix'] - output_values: ['contains_errors:bool', 'error_type:int'] - module: camera1 - class_name: DetectErrorsInCardboardUsingCamera1brief_description: Data service that, given the id of a camera2, provides a frame captured from that camera2. - detailed_description: Data service that, given the id of a camera2, provides a frame captured from that camera2.
        Recall that a camera2 is a camera device that points downwards to a conveyor belt of a specific production line that trasports stack of cutout cardboards produced by a specific diecutter.
        The data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the camera2 (an integer) and returns a frame captured from that camera2 as a numpy matrix.
        The matrix is a 2D array having a shape of (1080, 1920, 3) where 1080 is the height, 1920 is the width and 3 is the number of channels (RGB).

        In general each diecutter has exactly one chip embedded into it, and each chip is uniquely identified by an integer id. 
        This means that the chip id has a one-to-one correspondence with the id of the diecutter, but those two ids may not be the same.
        This data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the chip (an integer) and returns a single dictionary containing the current speed, temperature and number of rotations of the diecutter it is attached to.
        The keys of the dictionary are ""speed"", ""temperature"" and ""rotations"". 
        
        Example usage:
        - If the id of the chip is 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        chip_id = 123
        current_data = GetCurrentData.call(chip_id=123)
        # get the current speed, temperature and number of rotations
        current_speed = data[""speed""]
        current_temperature = data[""temperature""]
        current_rotations = data[""rotations""]
    
        Things to keep in mind:
        - The refresh rate of the data is 1 second, i.e. the data is updated every second, so if the data service is called multiple times within a second, it will return the same value.
        - Note that the values in the dictionary represents the current values of the speed, etc. of the diecutter, they are not aggregated values.
        - Remember that the output value is a dictionary with the above specified keys, so avoid trying to access it using keys not in the above example. - input_parameters: ['chip_id:int'] - output_values: ['diecutter_current_data:dict'] - module: diecutter - class_name: GetCurrentDataFromChip","from data_services.database import GetDiecutterChipIdFromDiecutterId

q0,6,Provide the serial numbers for cameras one and two from every diecutter in the plant.,"brief_description: Data service that, given the id of a camera1, provides a frame captured from that camera1. - detailed_description: Data service that, given the id of a camera1, provides a frame captured from that camera1.
        In general instances of camera1 point downwards to a conveyor belt of a specific production line that trasports single cutout cardboards produced by a specific diecutter.
        The data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the camera1 (an integer) and returns a frame captured from that camera1 as a numpy matrix.
        The matrix is a 2D array having a shape of (1080, 1920, 3) where 1080 is the height, 1920 is the width and 3 is the number of channels (RGB).

        Example usage:
        - If the id of the camera1 is 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        camera1_id = 123
        frame = GetFrameFromCamera1.call(camera1_id=123)
        # assuming the frame is a numpy matrix
        print(frame.shape)  # (1080, 1920, 3)

        Things to keep in mind:
        - The refresh rate of the camera is 1 second, i.e. the frame is updated every second, so if the data service is called multiple times within a second, it will return the same value.
        - The frame is a numpy matrix, so avoid trying to access it as a dictionary. - input_parameters: ['camera1_id:int'] - output_values: ['frame:np.matrix'] - module: camera1 - class_name: GetFrameFromCamera1brief_description: Data service that, given a frame captured from a specific camera1 and the identifier of that camera1, detects whether the frame contains a cardboard with errors and provide the type of error. - detailed_description: Data service that, given a frame captured from a specific camera1 and the identifier of that camera1, detects whether the frame contains a cardboard with errors.
        Recall that a camera1 is a camera device that points downwards to a conveyor belt of a specific production line that trasports single cutout cardboards produced by a specific diecutter.
        It takes two parameters, the id of the camera1 to use and the frame captured from that camera1.
        It returns a boolean value, True if the frame contains a cardboard with errors, False otherwise.
        Also it returns a integer value, 0 if the frame does not contain errors, 1 if the errors are of type hole and 2 if the errors are of type fold. 

        Example usage:
        - If frame is a variable containing the frame captured from the camera1 with id 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        camera1_id = 123
        contains_errors, type_errors = DetectErrorsInCardboardUsingCamera1.call(camera1_id=123, frame=frame)

        Things to keep in mind:
        - The output is a tuple of boolean and integer, so avoid trying to access it as a dictionary. - input_parameters: ['camera1_id:int', 'frame:np.matrix'] - output_values: ['contains_errors:bool', 'error_type:int'] - module: camera1 - class_name: DetectErrorsInCardboardUsingCamera1brief_description: Data service that, given the id of a camera2, provides a frame captured from that camera2. - detailed_description: Data service that, given the id of a camera2, provides a frame captured from that camera2.
        Recall that a camera2 is a camera device that points downwards to a conveyor belt of a specific production line that trasports stack of cutout cardboards produced by a specific diecutter.
        The data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the camera2 (an integer) and returns a frame captured from that camera2 as a numpy matrix.
        The matrix is a 2D array having a shape of (1080, 1920, 3) where 1080 is the height, 1920 is the width and 3 is the number of channels (RGB).

        camera2_id = 123
        frame = GetFrameFromCamera2.call(camera2_id=123)

        The data service relies on the management database of the cardboard factory to provide the camera1 serial.

        The data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the diecutter (an integer) and returns a single integer, which is the current session id of the diecutter.

        Example usage:
        - If the id of the diecutter is 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        diecutter_id = 123
        session_id = GetCurrentSessionIdFromDiecutterId.call(diecutter_id=123)
        # assuming the session id is 456
        print(session_id)  # 456

        Things to keep in mind:
        - The session id is an integer, so avoid trying to access it as a dictionary. - input_parameters: ['diecutter_id:int'] - output_values: ['session_id:int'] - module: database - class_name: GetCurrentSessionIdFromDiecutterIdbrief_description: Data service that, given a chip id of a chip embedded into a diecutter, provides the current speed, temperature and number of rotations measured by that chip. - detailed_description: Data service that, given a chip id of a chip embedded into a diecutter, provides the current speed, temperature and number of rotations measured by that chip.
        In general each diecutter has exactly one chip embedded into it, and each chip is uniquely identified by an integer id. 
        This means that the chip id has a one-to-one correspondence with the id of the diecutter, but those two ids may not be the same.
        This data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the chip (an integer) and returns a single dictionary containing the current speed, temperature and number of rotations of the diecutter it is attached to.
        The keys of the dictionary are ""speed"", ""temperature"" and ""rotations"". 
        
        Example usage:
        - If the id of the chip is 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        chip_id = 123
        current_data = GetCurrentData.call(chip_id=123)
        # get the current speed, temperature and number of rotations
        current_speed = data[""speed""]
        current_temperature = data[""temperature""]
        current_rotations = data[""rotations""]
    
        Things to keep in mind:
        - The refresh rate of the data is 1 second, i.e. the data is updated every second, so if the data service is called multiple times within a second, it will return the same value.
        - Note that the values in the dictionary represents the current values of the speed, etc. of the diecutter, they are not aggregated values.
        - Remember that the output value is a dictionary with the above specified keys, so avoid trying to access it using keys not in the above example. - input_parameters: ['chip_id:int'] - output_values: ['diecutter_current_data:dict'] - module: diecutter - class_name: GetCurrentDataFromChip","from data_services.database import GetDiecutterChipIdFromDiecutterId

q0,7,Retrieve the serial numbers for camera 1 and camera 2 from every diecutter within the plant.,"brief_description: Data service that, given the id of a camera1, provides a frame captured from that camera1. - detailed_description: Data service that, given the id of a camera1, provides a frame captured from that camera1.
        In general instances of camera1 point downwards to a conveyor belt of a specific production line that trasports single cutout cardboards produced by a specific diecutter.
        The data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the camera1 (an integer) and returns a frame captured from that camera1 as a numpy matrix.
        The matrix is a 2D array having a shape of (1080, 1920, 3) where 1080 is the height, 1920 is the width and 3 is the number of channels (RGB).

        Example usage:
        - If the id of the camera1 is 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        camera1_id = 123
        frame = GetFrameFromCamera1.call(camera1_id=123)
        # assuming the frame is a numpy matrix
        print(frame.shape)  # (1080, 1920, 3)

        Things to keep in mind:
        - The refresh rate of the camera is 1 second, i.e. the frame is updated every second, so if the data service is called multiple times within a second, it will return the same value.

        Recall that a camera1 is a camera device that points downwards to a conveyor belt of a specific production line that trasports single cutout cardboards produced by a specific diecutter.
        It takes two parameters, the id of the camera1 to use and the frame captured from that camera1.
        It returns a boolean value, True if the frame contains a cardboard with errors, False otherwise.
        Also it returns a integer value, 0 if the frame does not contain errors, 1 if the errors are of type hole and 2 if the errors are of type fold. 

        Example usage:
        - If frame is a variable containing the frame captured from the camera1 with id 123, then the data service would be called as follows:

        The data service relies on the management database of the cardboard factory to provide the session id.
        The data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the diecutter (an integer) and returns a single integer, which is the current session id of the diecutter.

        Example usage:
        - If the id of the diecutter is 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        diecutter_id = 123
        session_id = GetCurrentSessionIdFromDiecutterId.call(diecutter_id=123)
        # assuming the session id is 456
        print(session_id)  # 456

        Things to keep in mind:

        In general each diecutter has exactly one chip embedded into it, and each chip is uniquely identified by an integer id. 
        This means that the chip id has a one-to-one correspondence with the id of the diecutter, but those two ids may not be the same.
        This data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the chip (an integer) and returns a single dictionary containing the current speed, temperature and number of rotations of the diecutter it is attached to.
        The keys of the dictionary are ""speed"", ""temperature"" and ""rotations"". 
        
        Example usage:
        - If the id of the chip is 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        chip_id = 123
        current_data = GetCurrentData.call(chip_id=123)
        # get the current speed, temperature and number of rotations
        current_speed = data[""speed""]
        current_temperature = data[""temperature""]
        current_rotations = data[""rotations""]
    
        Things to keep in mind:
        - The refresh rate of the data is 1 second, i.e. the data is updated every second, so if the data service is called multiple times within a second, it will return the same value.
        - Note that the values in the dictionary represents the current values of the speed, etc. of the diecutter, they are not aggregated values.
        - Remember that the output value is a dictionary with the above specified keys, so avoid trying to access it using keys not in the above example. - input_parameters: ['chip_id:int'] - output_values: ['diecutter_current_data:dict'] - module: diecutter - class_name: GetCurrentDataFromChip","from data_services.database import GetDiecutterChipIdFromDiecutterId

q0,8,Provide the serial numbers for cameras 1 and 2 from each diecutter throughout the factory.,"brief_description: Data service that, given the id of a camera1, provides a frame captured from that camera1. - detailed_description: Data service that, given the id of a camera1, provides a frame captured from that camera1.
        In general instances of camera1 point downwards to a conveyor belt of a specific production line that trasports single cutout cardboards produced by a specific diecutter.
        The data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the camera1 (an integer) and returns a frame captured from that camera1 as a numpy matrix.
        The matrix is a 2D array having a shape of (1080, 1920, 3) where 1080 is the height, 1920 is the width and 3 is the number of channels (RGB).

        Example usage:
        - If the id of the camera1 is 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        camera1_id = 123

        # assuming the frame is a numpy matrix
        print(frame.shape)  # (1080, 1920, 3)

        Things to keep in mind:
        - The refresh rate of the camera is 1 second, i.e. the frame is updated every second, so if the data service is called multiple times within a second, it will return the same value.
        - The frame is a numpy matrix, so avoid trying to access it as a dictionary. - input_parameters: ['camera1_id:int'] - output_values: ['frame:np.matrix'] - module: camera1 - class_name: GetFrameFromCamera1brief_description: Data service that, given a frame captured from a specific camera1 and the identifier of that camera1, detects whether the frame contains a cardboard with errors and provide the type of error. - detailed_description: Data service that, given a frame captured from a specific camera1 and the identifier of that camera1, detects whether the frame contains a cardboard with errors.
        Recall that a camera1 is a camera device that points downwards to a conveyor belt of a specific production line that trasports single cutout cardboards produced by a specific diecutter.
        It takes two parameters, the id of the camera1 to use and the frame captured from that camera1.
        It returns a boolean value, True if the frame contains a cardboard with errors, False otherwise.
        Also it returns a integer value, 0 if the frame does not contain errors, 1 if the errors are of type hole and 2 if the errors are of type fold. 

        Example usage:
        - If frame is a variable containing the frame captured from the camera1 with id 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        camera1_id = 123
        contains_errors, type_errors = DetectErrorsInCardboardUsingCamera1.call(camera1_id=123, frame=frame)

        Things to keep in mind:

        Recall that a camera2 is a camera device that points downwards to a conveyor belt of a specific production line that trasports stack of cutout cardboards produced by a specific diecutter.
        The data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the camera2 (an integer) and returns a frame captured from that camera2 as a numpy matrix.
        The matrix is a 2D array having a shape of (1080, 1920, 3) where 1080 is the height, 1920 is the width and 3 is the number of channels (RGB).

        Example usage:
        - If the id of the camera2 is 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        camera2_id = 123
        frame = GetFrameFromCamera2.call(camera2_id=123)

        The data service relies on the management database of the cardboard factory to provide the list of diecutter id.
        The data service takes no parameter and returns a list of integers, which are the id of the diecutters installed in the factory.

        Example usage:

        In general each diecutter has exactly one chip embedded into it, and each chip is uniquely identified by an integer id. 
        This means that the chip id has a one-to-one correspondence with the id of the diecutter, but those two ids may not be the same.
        This data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the chip (an integer) and returns a single dictionary containing the current speed, temperature and number of rotations of the diecutter it is attached to.
        The keys of the dictionary are ""speed"", ""temperature"" and ""rotations"". 
        
        Example usage:
        - If the id of the chip is 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        chip_id = 123
        current_data = GetCurrentData.call(chip_id=123)
        # get the current speed, temperature and number of rotations
        current_speed = data[""speed""]
        current_temperature = data[""temperature""]
        current_rotations = data[""rotations""]
    
        Things to keep in mind:
        - The refresh rate of the data is 1 second, i.e. the data is updated every second, so if the data service is called multiple times within a second, it will return the same value.
        - Note that the values in the dictionary represents the current values of the speed, etc. of the diecutter, they are not aggregated values.
        - Remember that the output value is a dictionary with the above specified keys, so avoid trying to access it using keys not in the above example. - input_parameters: ['chip_id:int'] - output_values: ['diecutter_current_data:dict'] - module: diecutter - class_name: GetCurrentDataFromChip","from data_services.database import GetDiecutterChipIdFromDiecutterId

q0,9,Provide the serial numbers for cameras 1 and 2 from every diecutter in the plant.,"brief_description: Data service that, given the id of a camera1, provides a frame captured from that camera1. - detailed_description: Data service that, given the id of a camera1, provides a frame captured from that camera1.
        In general instances of camera1 point downwards to a conveyor belt of a specific production line that trasports single cutout cardboards produced by a specific diecutter.
        The data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the camera1 (an integer) and returns a frame captured from that camera1 as a numpy matrix.
        The matrix is a 2D array having a shape of (1080, 1920, 3) where 1080 is the height, 1920 is the width and 3 is the number of channels (RGB).

        Example usage:
        - If the id of the camera1 is 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        camera1_id = 123
        frame = GetFrameFromCamera1.call(camera1_id=123)
        # assuming the frame is a numpy matrix
        print(frame.shape)  # (1080, 1920, 3)

        Things to keep in mind:
        - The refresh rate of the camera is 1 second, i.e. the frame is updated every second, so if the data service is called multiple times within a second, it will return the same value.
        - The frame is a numpy matrix, so avoid trying to access it as a dictionary. - input_parameters: ['camera1_id:int'] - output_values: ['frame:np.matrix'] - module: camera1 - class_name: GetFrameFromCamera1brief_description: Data service that, given a frame captured from a specific camera1 and the identifier of that camera1, detects whether the frame contains a cardboard with errors and provide the type of error. - detailed_description: Data service that, given a frame captured from a specific camera1 and the identifier of that camera1, detects whether the frame contains a cardboard with errors.
        Recall that a camera1 is a camera device that points downwards to a conveyor belt of a specific production line that trasports single cutout cardboards produced by a specific diecutter.
        It takes two parameters, the id of the camera1 to use and the frame captured from that camera1.
        It returns a boolean value, True if the frame contains a cardboard with errors, False otherwise.
        Also it returns a integer value, 0 if the frame does not contain errors, 1 if the errors are of type hole and 2 if the errors are of type fold. 

        Example usage:
        - If frame is a variable containing the frame captured from the camera1 with id 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        camera1_id = 123
        contains_errors, type_errors = DetectErrorsInCardboardUsingCamera1.call(camera1_id=123, frame=frame)

        Things to keep in mind:
        - The output is a tuple of boolean and integer, so avoid trying to access it as a dictionary. - input_parameters: ['camera1_id:int', 'frame:np.matrix'] - output_values: ['contains_errors:bool', 'error_type:int'] - module: camera1 - class_name: DetectErrorsInCardboardUsingCamera1brief_description: Data service that, given the id of a camera2, provides a frame captured from that camera2. - detailed_description: Data service that, given the id of a camera2, provides a frame captured from that camera2.
        Recall that a camera2 is a camera device that points downwards to a conveyor belt of a specific production line that trasports stack of cutout cardboards produced by a specific diecutter.
        The data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the camera2 (an integer) and returns a frame captured from that camera2 as a numpy matrix.
        The matrix is a 2D array having a shape of (1080, 1920, 3) where 1080 is the height, 1920 is the width and 3 is the number of channels (RGB).

        camera2_id = 123
        frame = GetFrameFromCamera2.call(camera2_id=123)

        In general each diecutter has exactly one chip embedded into it, and each chip is uniquely identified by an integer id. 
        This means that the chip id has a one-to-one correspondence with the id of the diecutter, but those two ids may not be the same.
        This data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the chip (an integer) and returns a single dictionary containing the current speed, temperature and number of rotations of the diecutter it is attached to.
        The keys of the dictionary are ""speed"", ""temperature"" and ""rotations"". 
        
        Example usage:
        - If the id of the chip is 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        chip_id = 123
        current_data = GetCurrentData.call(chip_id=123)
        # get the current speed, temperature and number of rotations
        current_speed = data[""speed""]
        current_temperature = data[""temperature""]
        current_rotations = data[""rotations""]
    
        Things to keep in mind:
        - The refresh rate of the data is 1 second, i.e. the data is updated every second, so if the data service is called multiple times within a second, it will return the same value.
        - Note that the values in the dictionary represents the current values of the speed, etc. of the diecutter, they are not aggregated values.
        - Remember that the output value is a dictionary with the above specified keys, so avoid trying to access it using keys not in the above example. - input_parameters: ['chip_id:int'] - output_values: ['diecutter_current_data:dict'] - module: diecutter - class_name: GetCurrentDataFromChip","from data_services.database import GetDiecutterChipIdFromDiecutterId

q1,0,Generate a table containing the max speed of the diecutter with id 25 over a time span of 30 seconds.,"brief_description: Data service that, given the id of a camera1, provides a frame captured from that camera1. - detailed_description: Data service that, given the id of a camera1, provides a frame captured from that camera1.
        In general instances of camera1 point downwards to a conveyor belt of a specific production line that trasports single cutout cardboards produced by a specific diecutter.
        The data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the camera1 (an integer) and returns a frame captured from that camera1 as a numpy matrix.
        The matrix is a 2D array having a shape of (1080, 1920, 3) where 1080 is the height, 1920 is the width and 3 is the number of channels (RGB).

        Example usage:
        - If the id of the camera1 is 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        camera1_id = 123
        frame = GetFrameFromCamera1.call(camera1_id=123)
        # assuming the frame is a numpy matrix
        print(frame.shape)  # (1080, 1920, 3)

        Things to keep in mind:
        - The refresh rate of the camera is 1 second, i.e. the frame is updated every second, so if the data service is called multiple times within a second, it will return the same value.
        - The frame is a numpy matrix, so avoid trying to access it as a dictionary. - input_parameters: ['camera1_id:int'] - output_values: ['frame:np.matrix'] - module: camera1 - class_name: GetFrameFromCamera1brief_description: Data service that, given a frame captured from a specific camera1 and the identifier of that camera1, detects whether the frame contains a cardboard with errors and provide the type of error. - detailed_description: Data service that, given a frame captured from a specific camera1 and the identifier of that camera1, detects whether the frame contains a cardboard with errors.
        Recall that a camera1 is a camera device that points downwards to a conveyor belt of a specific production line that trasports single cutout cardboards produced by a specific diecutter.
        It takes two parameters, the id of the camera1 to use and the frame captured from that camera1.
        It returns a boolean value, True if the frame contains a cardboard with errors, False otherwise.
        Also it returns a integer value, 0 if the frame does not contain errors, 1 if the errors are of type hole and 2 if the errors are of type fold. 

        Example usage:
        - If frame is a variable containing the frame captured from the camera1 with id 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        camera1_id = 123
        contains_errors, type_errors = DetectErrorsInCardboardUsingCamera1.call(camera1_id=123, frame=frame)

        Things to keep in mind:
        - The output is a tuple of boolean and integer, so avoid trying to access it as a dictionary. - input_parameters: ['camera1_id:int', 'frame:np.matrix'] - output_values: ['contains_errors:bool', 'error_type:int'] - module: camera1 - class_name: DetectErrorsInCardboardUsingCamera1brief_description: Data service that, given the id of a camera2, provides a frame captured from that camera2. - detailed_description: Data service that, given the id of a camera2, provides a frame captured from that camera2.
        Recall that a camera2 is a camera device that points downwards to a conveyor belt of a specific production line that trasports stack of cutout cardboards produced by a specific diecutter.
        The data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the camera2 (an integer) and returns a frame captured from that camera2 as a numpy matrix.
        The matrix is a 2D array having a shape of (1080, 1920, 3) where 1080 is the height, 1920 is the width and 3 is the number of channels (RGB).

        The data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the diecutter (an integer) and returns a single integer, which is the current session id of the diecutter.

        Example usage:
        - If the id of the diecutter is 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        diecutter_id = 123
        session_id = GetCurrentSessionIdFromDiecutterId.call(diecutter_id=123)
        # assuming the session id is 456
        print(session_id)  # 456

        Things to keep in mind:
        - The session id is an integer, so avoid trying to access it as a dictionary. - input_parameters: ['diecutter_id:int'] - output_values: ['session_id:int'] - module: database - class_name: GetCurrentSessionIdFromDiecutterIdbrief_description: Data service that, given a chip id of a chip embedded into a diecutter, provides the current speed, temperature and number of rotations measured by that chip. - detailed_description: Data service that, given a chip id of a chip embedded into a diecutter, provides the current speed, temperature and number of rotations measured by that chip.
        In general each diecutter has exactly one chip embedded into it, and each chip is uniquely identified by an integer id. 
        This means that the chip id has a one-to-one correspondence with the id of the diecutter, but those two ids may not be the same.
        This data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the chip (an integer) and returns a single dictionary containing the current speed, temperature and number of rotations of the diecutter it is attached to.
        The keys of the dictionary are ""speed"", ""temperature"" and ""rotations"". 
        
        Example usage:
        - If the id of the chip is 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        chip_id = 123
        current_data = GetCurrentData.call(chip_id=123)
        # get the current speed, temperature and number of rotations
        current_speed = data[""speed""]
        current_temperature = data[""temperature""]
        current_rotations = data[""rotations""]
    
        Things to keep in mind:
        - The refresh rate of the data is 1 second, i.e. the data is updated every second, so if the data service is called multiple times within a second, it will return the same value.
        - Note that the values in the dictionary represents the current values of the speed, etc. of the diecutter, they are not aggregated values.
        - Remember that the output value is a dictionary with the above specified keys, so avoid trying to access it using keys not in the above example. - input_parameters: ['chip_id:int'] - output_values: ['diecutter_current_data:dict'] - module: diecutter - class_name: GetCurrentDataFromChip","from data_services.database import GetDiecutterChipIdFromDiecutterId

        In general instances of camera1 point downwards to a conveyor belt of a specific production line that trasports single cutout cardboards produced by a specific diecutter.
        The data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the camera1 (an integer) and returns a frame captured from that camera1 as a numpy matrix.
        The matrix is a 2D array having a shape of (1080, 1920, 3) where 1080 is the height, 1920 is the width and 3 is the number of channels (RGB).

        Example usage:
        - If the id of the camera1 is 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        camera1_id = 123
        frame = GetFrameFromCamera1.call(camera1_id=123)

        Things to keep in mind:
        - The refresh rate of the camera is 1 second, i.e. the frame is updated every second, so if the data service is called multiple times within a second, it will return the same value.

        Recall that a camera1 is a camera device that points downwards to a conveyor belt of a specific production line that trasports single cutout cardboards produced by a specific diecutter.
        It takes two parameters, the id of the camera1 to use and the frame captured from that camera1.
        It returns a boolean value, True if the frame contains a cardboard with errors, False otherwise.
        Also it returns a integer value, 0 if the frame does not contain errors, 1 if the errors are of type hole and 2 if the errors are of type fold. 

        Example usage:
        - If frame is a variable containing the frame captured from the camera1 with id 123, then the data service would be called as follows:

        The data service relies on the management database of the cardboard factory to provide the session id.
        The data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the diecutter (an integer) and returns a single integer, which is the current session id of the diecutter.

        Example usage:
        - If the id of the diecutter is 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        diecutter_id = 123
        session_id = GetCurrentSessionIdFromDiecutterId.call(diecutter_id=123)
        # assuming the session id is 456
        print(session_id)  # 456

        Things to keep in mind:

        In general each diecutter has exactly one chip embedded into it, and each chip is uniquely identified by an integer id. 
        This means that the chip id has a one-to-one correspondence with the id of the diecutter, but those two ids may not be the same.
        This data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the chip (an integer) and returns a single dictionary containing the current speed, temperature and number of rotations of the diecutter it is attached to.
        The keys of the dictionary are ""speed"", ""temperature"" and ""rotations"". 
        
        Example usage:
        - If the id of the chip is 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        chip_id = 123
        current_data = GetCurrentData.call(chip_id=123)
        # get the current speed, temperature and number of rotations
        current_speed = data[""speed""]
        current_temperature = data[""temperature""]
        current_rotations = data[""rotations""]
    
        Things to keep in mind:
        - The refresh rate of the data is 1 second, i.e. the data is updated every second, so if the data service is called multiple times within a second, it will return the same value.
        - Note that the values in the dictionary represents the current values of the speed, etc. of the diecutter, they are not aggregated values.
        - Remember that the output value is a dictionary with the above specified keys, so avoid trying to access it using keys not in the above example. - input_parameters: ['chip_id:int'] - output_values: ['diecutter_current_data:dict'] - module: diecutter - class_name: GetCurrentDataFromChip","from data_services.database import GetDiecutterChipIdFromDiecutterId

q1,2,Create a table showing the highest speed reached by the diecutter identified by ID 25 in a duration of 30 seconds.,"brief_description: Data service that, given the id of a camera1, provides a frame captured from that camera1. - detailed_description: Data service that, given the id of a camera1, provides a frame captured from that camera1.
        In general instances of camera1 point downwards to a conveyor belt of a specific production line that trasports single cutout cardboards produced by a specific diecutter.
        The data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the camera1 (an integer) and returns a frame captured from that camera1 as a numpy matrix.
        The matrix is a 2D array having a shape of (1080, 1920, 3) where 1080 is the height, 1920 is the width and 3 is the number of channels (RGB).

        Example usage:
        - If the id of the camera1 is 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        camera1_id = 123

        # assuming the frame is a numpy matrix
        print(frame.shape)  # (1080, 1920, 3)

        Things to keep in mind:
        - The refresh rate of the camera is 1 second, i.e. the frame is updated every second, so if the data service is called multiple times within a second, it will return the same value.
        - The frame is a numpy matrix, so avoid trying to access it as a dictionary. - input_parameters: ['camera1_id:int'] - output_values: ['frame:np.matrix'] - module: camera1 - class_name: GetFrameFromCamera1brief_description: Data service that, given a frame captured from a specific camera1 and the identifier of that camera1, detects whether the frame contains a cardboard with errors and provide the type of error. - detailed_description: Data service that, given a frame captured from a specific camera1 and the identifier of that camera1, detects whether the frame contains a cardboard with errors.
        Recall that a camera1 is a camera device that points downwards to a conveyor belt of a specific production line that trasports single cutout cardboards produced by a specific diecutter.
        It takes two parameters, the id of the camera1 to use and the frame captured from that camera1.
        It returns a boolean value, True if the frame contains a cardboard with errors, False otherwise.
        Also it returns a integer value, 0 if the frame does not contain errors, 1 if the errors are of type hole and 2 if the errors are of type fold. 

        Example usage:
        - If frame is a variable containing the frame captured from the camera1 with id 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        camera1_id = 123
        contains_errors, type_errors = DetectErrorsInCardboardUsingCamera1.call(camera1_id=123, frame=frame)

        Things to keep in mind:

        Recall that a camera2 is a camera device that points downwards to a conveyor belt of a specific production line that trasports stack of cutout cardboards produced by a specific diecutter.
        The data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the camera2 (an integer) and returns a frame captured from that camera2 as a numpy matrix.
        The matrix is a 2D array having a shape of (1080, 1920, 3) where 1080 is the height, 1920 is the width and 3 is the number of channels (RGB).

        Example usage:
        - If the id of the camera2 is 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        camera2_id = 123
        frame = GetFrameFromCamera2.call(camera2_id=123)

        The data service relies on the management database of the cardboard factory to provide the list of diecutter id.
        The data service takes no parameter and returns a list of integers, which are the id of the diecutters installed in the factory.

        Example usage:

        In general each diecutter has exactly one chip embedded into it, and each chip is uniquely identified by an integer id. 
        This means that the chip id has a one-to-one correspondence with the id of the diecutter, but those two ids may not be the same.
        This data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the chip (an integer) and returns a single dictionary containing the current speed, temperature and number of rotations of the diecutter it is attached to.
        The keys of the dictionary are ""speed"", ""temperature"" and ""rotations"". 
        
        Example usage:
        - If the id of the chip is 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        chip_id = 123
        current_data = GetCurrentData.call(chip_id=123)
        # get the current speed, temperature and number of rotations
        current_speed = data[""speed""]
        current_temperature = data[""temperature""]
        current_rotations = data[""rotations""]
    
        Things to keep in mind:
        - The refresh rate of the data is 1 second, i.e. the data is updated every second, so if the data service is called multiple times within a second, it will return the same value.
        - Note that the values in the dictionary represents the current values of the speed, etc. of the diecutter, they are not aggregated values.
        - Remember that the output value is a dictionary with the above specified keys, so avoid trying to access it using keys not in the above example. - input_parameters: ['chip_id:int'] - output_values: ['diecutter_current_data:dict'] - module: diecutter - class_name: GetCurrentDataFromChip","from data_services.database import GetDiecutterChipIdFromDiecutterId

q1,3,Produce a table showing the maximum speed of the diecutter identified by id 25 within a 30-second interval.,"brief_description: Data service that, given the id of a camera1, provides a frame captured from that camera1. - detailed_description: Data service that, given the id of a camera1, provides a frame captured from that camera1.
        In general instances of camera1 point downwards to a conveyor belt of a specific production line that trasports single cutout cardboards produced by a specific diecutter.
        The data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the camera1 (an integer) and returns a frame captured from that camera1 as a numpy matrix.
        The matrix is a 2D array having a shape of (1080, 1920, 3) where 1080 is the height, 1920 is the width and 3 is the number of channels (RGB).

        Example usage:
        - If the id of the camera1 is 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        camera1_id = 123
        frame = GetFrameFromCamera1.call(camera1_id=123)
        # assuming the frame is a numpy matrix
        print(frame.shape)  # (1080, 1920, 3)

        Things to keep in mind:
        - The refresh rate of the camera is 1 second, i.e. the frame is updated every second, so if the data service is called multiple times within a second, it will return the same value.
        - The frame is a numpy matrix, so avoid trying to access it as a dictionary. - input_parameters: ['camera1_id:int'] - output_values: ['frame:np.matrix'] - module: camera1 - class_name: GetFrameFromCamera1brief_description: Data service that, given a frame captured from a specific camera1 and the identifier of that camera1, detects whether the frame contains a cardboard with errors and provide the type of error. - detailed_description: Data service that, given a frame captured from a specific camera1 and the identifier of that camera1, detects whether the frame contains a cardboard with errors.
        Recall that a camera1 is a camera device that points downwards to a conveyor belt of a specific production line that trasports single cutout cardboards produced by a specific diecutter.
        It takes two parameters, the id of the camera1 to use and the frame captured from that camera1.
        It returns a boolean value, True if the frame contains a cardboard with errors, False otherwise.
        Also it returns a integer value, 0 if the frame does not contain errors, 1 if the errors are of type hole and 2 if the errors are of type fold. 

        Example usage:
        - If frame is a variable containing the frame captured from the camera1 with id 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        camera1_id = 123
        contains_errors, type_errors = DetectErrorsInCardboardUsingCamera1.call(camera1_id=123, frame=frame)

        Things to keep in mind:

        Recall that a camera2 is a camera device that points downwards to a conveyor belt of a specific production line that trasports stack of cutout cardboards produced by a specific diecutter.
        The data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the camera2 (an integer) and returns a frame captured from that camera2 as a numpy matrix.
        The matrix is a 2D array having a shape of (1080, 1920, 3) where 1080 is the height, 1920 is the width and 3 is the number of channels (RGB).

        In general each diecutter has exactly one chip embedded into it, and each chip is uniquely identified by an integer id. 
        This means that the chip id has a one-to-one correspondence with the id of the diecutter, but those two ids may not be the same.
        This data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the chip (an integer) and returns a single dictionary containing the current speed, temperature and number of rotations of the diecutter it is attached to.
        The keys of the dictionary are ""speed"", ""temperature"" and ""rotations"". 
        
        Example usage:
        - If the id of the chip is 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        chip_id = 123
        current_data = GetCurrentData.call(chip_id=123)
        # get the current speed, temperature and number of rotations
        current_speed = data[""speed""]
        current_temperature = data[""temperature""]
        current_rotations = data[""rotations""]
    
        Things to keep in mind:
        - The refresh rate of the data is 1 second, i.e. the data is updated every second, so if the data service is called multiple times within a second, it will return the same value.
        - Note that the values in the dictionary represents the current values of the speed, etc. of the diecutter, they are not aggregated values.
        - Remember that the output value is a dictionary with the above specified keys, so avoid trying to access it using keys not in the above example. - input_parameters: ['chip_id:int'] - output_values: ['diecutter_current_data:dict'] - module: diecutter - class_name: GetCurrentDataFromChip","from data_services.database import GetCurrentDataFromChip, GetSerialCamera1IdFromDiecutterId, GetSerialCamera2IdFromDiecutterId, GetDiecuttersIdOfFactory

q1,4,Create a table showing the highest speed reached by the diecutter identified by id 25 within a 30-second interval.,"brief_description: Data service that, given the id of a camera1, provides a frame captured from that camera1. - detailed_description: Data service that, given the id of a camera1, provides a frame captured from that camera1.
        In general instances of camera1 point downwards to a conveyor belt of a specific production line that trasports single cutout cardboards produced by a specific diecutter.
        The data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the camera1 (an integer) and returns a frame captured from that camera1 as a numpy matrix.
        The matrix is a 2D array having a shape of (1080, 1920, 3) where 1080 is the height, 1920 is the width and 3 is the number of channels (RGB).

        Example usage:
        - If the id of the camera1 is 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        camera1_id = 123
        frame = GetFrameFromCamera1.call(camera1_id=123)
        # assuming the frame is a numpy matrix
        print(frame.shape)  # (1080, 1920, 3)

        Things to keep in mind:
        - The refresh rate of the camera is 1 second, i.e. the frame is updated every second, so if the data service is called multiple times within a second, it will return the same value.
        - The frame is a numpy matrix, so avoid trying to access it as a dictionary. - input_parameters: ['camera1_id:int'] - output_values: ['frame:np.matrix'] - module: camera1 - class_name: GetFrameFromCamera1brief_description: Data service that, given a frame captured from a specific camera1 and the identifier of that camera1, detects whether the frame contains a cardboard with errors and provide the type of error. - detailed_description: Data service that, given a frame captured from a specific camera1 and the identifier of that camera1, detects whether the frame contains a cardboard with errors.
        Recall that a camera1 is a camera device that points downwards to a conveyor belt of a specific production line that trasports single cutout cardboards produced by a specific diecutter.
        It takes two parameters, the id of the camera1 to use and the frame captured from that camera1.
        It returns a boolean value, True if the frame contains a cardboard with errors, False otherwise.
        Also it returns a integer value, 0 if the frame does not contain errors, 1 if the errors are of type hole and 2 if the errors are of type fold. 

        Example usage:
        - If frame is a variable containing the frame captured from the camera1 with id 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        camera1_id = 123
        contains_errors, type_errors = DetectErrorsInCardboardUsingCamera1.call(camera1_id=123, frame=frame)

        Things to keep in mind:

        Recall that a camera2 is a camera device that points downwards to a conveyor belt of a specific production line that trasports stack of cutout cardboards produced by a specific diecutter.
        The data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the camera2 (an integer) and returns a frame captured from that camera2 as a numpy matrix.

        In general each diecutter has exactly one chip embedded into it, and each chip is uniquely identified by an integer id. 
        This means that the chip id has a one-to-one correspondence with the id of the diecutter, but those two ids may not be the same.
        This data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the chip (an integer) and returns a single dictionary containing the current speed, temperature and number of rotations of the diecutter it is attached to.
        The keys of the dictionary are ""speed"", ""temperature"" and ""rotations"". 
        
        Example usage:
        - If the id of the chip is 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        chip_id = 123
        current_data = GetCurrentData.call(chip_id=123)
        # get the current speed, temperature and number of rotations
        current_speed = data[""speed""]
        current_temperature = data[""temperature""]
        current_rotations = data[""rotations""]
    
        Things to keep in mind:
        - The refresh rate of the data is 1 second, i.e. the data is updated every second, so if the data service is called multiple times within a second, it will return the same value.
        - Note that the values in the dictionary represents the current values of the speed, etc. of the diecutter, they are not aggregated values.
        - Remember that the output value is a dictionary with the above specified keys, so avoid trying to access it using keys not in the above example. - input_parameters: ['chip_id:int'] - output_values: ['diecutter_current_data:dict'] - module: diecutter - class_name: GetCurrentDataFromChip","from data_services.database import GetDiecutterChipIdFromDiecutterId

q1,5,Create a table that shows the maximum speed of the diecutter identified by id 25 during a 30-second interval.,"brief_description: Data service that, given the id of a camera1, provides a frame captured from that camera1. - detailed_description: Data service that, given the id of a camera1, provides a frame captured from that camera1.
        In general instances of camera1 point downwards to a conveyor belt of a specific production line that trasports single cutout cardboards produced by a specific diecutter.
        The data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the camera1 (an integer) and returns a frame captured from that camera1 as a numpy matrix.
        The matrix is a 2D array having a shape of (1080, 1920, 3) where 1080 is the height, 1920 is the width and 3 is the number of channels (RGB).

        Example usage:
        - If the id of the camera1 is 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        camera1_id = 123
        frame = GetFrameFromCamera1.call(camera1_id=123)
        # assuming the frame is a numpy matrix
        print(frame.shape)  # (1080, 1920, 3)

        Things to keep in mind:
        - The refresh rate of the camera is 1 second, i.e. the frame is updated every second, so if the data service is called multiple times within a second, it will return the same value.
        - The frame is a numpy matrix, so avoid trying to access it as a dictionary. - input_parameters: ['camera1_id:int'] - output_values: ['frame:np.matrix'] - module: camera1 - class_name: GetFrameFromCamera1brief_description: Data service that, given a frame captured from a specific camera1 and the identifier of that camera1, detects whether the frame contains a cardboard with errors and provide the type of error. - detailed_description: Data service that, given a frame captured from a specific camera1 and the identifier of that camera1, detects whether the frame contains a cardboard with errors.
        Recall that a camera1 is a camera device that points downwards to a conveyor belt of a specific production line that trasports single cutout cardboards produced by a specific diecutter.
        It takes two parameters, the id of the camera1 to use and the frame captured from that camera1.
        It returns a boolean value, True if the frame contains a cardboard with errors, False otherwise.
        Also it returns a integer value, 0 if the frame does not contain errors, 1 if the errors are of type hole and 2 if the errors are of type fold. 

        Example usage:
        - If frame is a variable containing the frame captured from the camera1 with id 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        camera1_id = 123
        contains_errors, type_errors = DetectErrorsInCardboardUsingCamera1.call(camera1_id=123, frame=frame)

        Things to keep in mind:
        - The output is a tuple of boolean and integer, so avoid trying to access it as a dictionary. - input_parameters: ['camera1_id:int', 'frame:np.matrix'] - output_values: ['contains_errors:bool', 'error_type:int'] - module: camera1 - class_name: DetectErrorsInCardboardUsingCamera1brief_description: Data service that, given the id of a camera2, provides a frame captured from that camera2. - detailed_description: Data service that, given the id of a camera2, provides a frame captured from that camera2.
        Recall that a camera2 is a camera device that points downwards to a conveyor belt of a specific production line that trasports stack of cutout cardboards produced by a specific diecutter.
        The data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the camera2 (an integer) and returns a frame captured from that camera2 as a numpy matrix.
        The matrix is a 2D array having a shape of (1080, 1920, 3) where 1080 is the height, 1920 is the width and 3 is the number of channels (RGB).

        - The session id is an integer, so avoid trying to access it as a dictionary. - input_parameters: ['diecutter_id:int'] - output_values: ['session_id:int'] - module: database - class_name: GetCurrentSessionIdFromDiecutterIdbrief_description: Data service that, given a chip id of a chip embedded into a diecutter, provides the current speed, temperature and number of rotations measured by that chip. - detailed_description: Data service that, given a chip id of a chip embedded into a diecutter, provides the current speed, temperature and number of rotations measured by that chip.
        In general each diecutter has exactly one chip embedded into it, and each chip is uniquely identified by an integer id. 
        This means that the chip id has a one-to-one correspondence with the id of the diecutter, but those two ids may not be the same.
        This data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the chip (an integer) and returns a single dictionary containing the current speed, temperature and number of rotations of the diecutter it is attached to.
        The keys of the dictionary are ""speed"", ""temperature"" and ""rotations"". 
        
        Example usage:
        - If the id of the chip is 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        chip_id = 123
        current_data = GetCurrentData.call(chip_id=123)
        # get the current speed, temperature and number of rotations
        current_speed = data[""speed""]
        current_temperature = data[""temperature""]
        current_rotations = data[""rotations""]
    
        Things to keep in mind:
        - The refresh rate of the data is 1 second, i.e. the data is updated every second, so if the data service is called multiple times within a second, it will return the same value.
        - Note that the values in the dictionary represents the current values of the speed, etc. of the diecutter, they are not aggregated values.
        - Remember that the output value is a dictionary with the above specified keys, so avoid trying to access it using keys not in the above example. - input_parameters: ['chip_id:int'] - output_values: ['diecutter_current_data:dict'] - module: diecutter - class_name: GetCurrentDataFromChip","from data_services.database import GetDiecutterChipIdFromDiecutterId

        In general instances of camera1 point downwards to a conveyor belt of a specific production line that trasports single cutout cardboards produced by a specific diecutter.
        The data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the camera1 (an integer) and returns a frame captured from that camera1 as a numpy matrix.
        The matrix is a 2D array having a shape of (1080, 1920, 3) where 1080 is the height, 1920 is the width and 3 is the number of channels (RGB).

        Example usage:
        - If the id of the camera1 is 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        camera1_id = 123

        Recall that a camera1 is a camera device that points downwards to a conveyor belt of a specific production line that trasports single cutout cardboards produced by a specific diecutter.
        It takes two parameters, the id of the camera1 to use and the frame captured from that camera1.
        It returns a boolean value, True if the frame contains a cardboard with errors, False otherwise.
        Also it returns a integer value, 0 if the frame does not contain errors, 1 if the errors are of type hole and 2 if the errors are of type fold. 

        Example usage:

        - The serial is an integer, so avoid trying to access it as a dictionary. - input_parameters: ['diecutter_id:int'] - output_values: ['serial_camera2:int'] - module: database - class_name: GetSerialCamera2IdFromDiecutterIdbrief_description: Data service that provides the list of id of the diecutters installed in the factory. - detailed_description: Data service that provides the id of the diecutter installed in the factory.
        The data service relies on the management database of the cardboard factory to provide the list of diecutter id.
        The data service takes no parameter and returns a list of integers, which are the id of the diecutters installed in the factory.

        Example usage:
        - The data service would be called as follows:
        diecutters_id = GetDiecuttersIdOfFactory.call()
        # assuming the diecutters id are [1, 2, 3]
        print(diecutters_id)  # [1, 2, 3]

        Things to keep in mind:
        - The diecutters id is a list of integers, so avoid trying to access it as a dictionary. - input_parameters: [] - output_values: ['diecutters_id:list'] - module: database - class_name: GetDiecuttersIdOfFactorybrief_description: Data service that, given the id of a diecutter, provides the id of the chip embedded into that diecutter. - detailed_description: Data service that, given the id of a diecutter, provides the id of the chip embedded into that diecutter.
        The data service relies on the management database of the cardboard factory to provide the chip id.
        The data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the diecutter (an integer) and returns a single integer, which is the chip id of the diecutter.

        Example usage:
        - If the id of the diecutter is 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        diecutter_id = 123
        chip_id = GetDiecutterChipIdFromDiecutterId.call(diecutter_id=123)
        # assuming the chip id is 456
        print(chip_id)  # 456

        # assuming the camera1 id is 456
        print(camera1_id)  # 456

        Things to keep in mind:
        - The camera1 id is an integer, so avoid trying to access it as a dictionary. - input_parameters: ['diecutter_id:int'] - output_values: ['camera1_id:int'] - module: database - class_name: GetCamera1IdFromDiecutterIdbrief_description: Data service that, given the id of a diecutter, provides the id of the camera2 used to capture the frames of the cardboard cutouts produced by that diecutter. - detailed_description: Data service that, given the id of a diecutter, provides the id of the camera2 used to capture the frames of the cardboard cutouts produced by that diecutter.
        The data service relies on the management database of the cardboard factory to provide the camera2 id.
        The data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the diecutter (an integer) and returns a single integer, which is the id of the camera2 used to capture the frames of the cardboard cutouts produced by that diecutter.

        - If the id of the diecutter is 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        diecutter_id = 123
        camera2_id = GetCamera2IdFromDiecutterId.call(diecutter_id=123)
        # assuming the camera2 id is 456
        print(camera2_id)  # 456

        Things to keep in mind:
        - The camera2 id is an integer, so avoid trying to access it as a dictionary. - input_parameters: ['diecutter_id:int'] - output_values: ['camera2_id:int'] - module: database - class_name: GetCamera2IdFromDiecutterIdbrief_description: Data service that, given the id of a diecutter, provides the current session id of that diecutter. - detailed_description: Data service that, given the id of a diecutter, provides the current session id of that diecutter.
        The data service relies on the management database of the cardboard factory to provide the session id.
        The data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the diecutter (an integer) and returns a single integer, which is the current session id of the diecutter.

        Example usage:
        - If the id of the diecutter is 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        diecutter_id = 123
        session_id = GetCurrentSessionIdFromDiecutterId.call(diecutter_id=123)
        # assuming the session id is 456
        print(session_id)  # 456

        Things to keep in mind:
        - The session id is an integer, so avoid trying to access it as a dictionary. - input_parameters: ['diecutter_id:int'] - output_values: ['session_id:int'] - module: database - class_name: GetCurrentSessionIdFromDiecutterIdbrief_description: Data service that, given a chip id of a chip embedded into a diecutter, provides the current speed, temperature and number of rotations measured by that chip. - detailed_description: Data service that, given a chip id of a chip embedded into a diecutter, provides the current speed, temperature and number of rotations measured by that chip.
        In general each diecutter has exactly one chip embedded into it, and each chip is uniquely identified by an integer id. 
        This means that the chip id has a one-to-one correspondence with the id of the diecutter, but those two ids may not be the same.
        This data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the chip (an integer) and returns a single dictionary containing the current speed, temperature and number of rotations of the diecutter it is attached to.
        The keys of the dictionary are ""speed"", ""temperature"" and ""rotations"". 
        
        Example usage:
        - If the id of the chip is 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        chip_id = 123
        current_data = GetCurrentData.call(chip_id=123)
        # get the current speed, temperature and number of rotations
        current_speed = data[""speed""]
        current_temperature = data[""temperature""]
        current_rotations = data[""rotations""]
    
        Things to keep in mind:
        - The refresh rate of the data is 1 second, i.e. the data is updated every second, so if the data service is called multiple times within a second, it will return the same value.
        - Note that the values in the dictionary represents the current values of the speed, etc. of the diecutter, they are not aggregated values.
        - Remember that the output value is a dictionary with the above specified keys, so avoid trying to access it using keys not in the above example. - input_parameters: ['chip_id:int'] - output_values: ['diecutter_current_data:dict'] - module: diecutter - class_name: GetCurrentDataFromChip","from data_services.database import GetDiecutterChipIdFromDiecutterId

q1,7,Create a table showing the highest speed of the diecutter identified by id 25 over a period of 30 seconds.,"brief_description: Data service that, given the id of a camera1, provides a frame captured from that camera1. - detailed_description: Data service that, given the id of a camera1, provides a frame captured from that camera1.
        In general instances of camera1 point downwards to a conveyor belt of a specific production line that trasports single cutout cardboards produced by a specific diecutter.
        The data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the camera1 (an integer) and returns a frame captured from that camera1 as a numpy matrix.
        The matrix is a 2D array having a shape of (1080, 1920, 3) where 1080 is the height, 1920 is the width and 3 is the number of channels (RGB).

        Example usage:
        - If the id of the camera1 is 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        camera1_id = 123
        frame = GetFrameFromCamera1.call(camera1_id=123)
        # assuming the frame is a numpy matrix
        print(frame.shape)  # (1080, 1920, 3)

        Things to keep in mind:
        - The refresh rate of the camera is 1 second, i.e. the frame is updated every second, so if the data service is called multiple times within a second, it will return the same value.
        - The frame is a numpy matrix, so avoid trying to access it as a dictionary. - input_parameters: ['camera1_id:int'] - output_values: ['frame:np.matrix'] - module: camera1 - class_name: GetFrameFromCamera1brief_description: Data service that, given a frame captured from a specific camera1 and the identifier of that camera1, detects whether the frame contains a cardboard with errors and provide the type of error. - detailed_description: Data service that, given a frame captured from a specific camera1 and the identifier of that camera1, detects whether the frame contains a cardboard with errors.
        Recall that a camera1 is a camera device that points downwards to a conveyor belt of a specific production line that trasports single cutout cardboards produced by a specific diecutter.
        It takes two parameters, the id of the camera1 to use and the frame captured from that camera1.
        It returns a boolean value, True if the frame contains a cardboard with errors, False otherwise.
        Also it returns a integer value, 0 if the frame does not contain errors, 1 if the errors are of type hole and 2 if the errors are of type fold. 

        Example usage:
        - If frame is a variable containing the frame captured from the camera1 with id 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        camera1_id = 123
        contains_errors, type_errors = DetectErrorsInCardboardUsingCamera1.call(camera1_id=123, frame=frame)

        Things to keep in mind:
        - The output is a tuple of boolean and integer, so avoid trying to access it as a dictionary. - input_parameters: ['camera1_id:int', 'frame:np.matrix'] - output_values: ['contains_errors:bool', 'error_type:int'] - module: camera1 - class_name: DetectErrorsInCardboardUsingCamera1brief_description: Data service that, given the id of a camera2, provides a frame captured from that camera2. - detailed_description: Data service that, given the id of a camera2, provides a frame captured from that camera2.
        Recall that a camera2 is a camera device that points downwards to a conveyor belt of a specific production line that trasports stack of cutout cardboards produced by a specific diecutter.
        The data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the camera2 (an integer) and returns a frame captured from that camera2 as a numpy matrix.
        The matrix is a 2D array having a shape of (1080, 1920, 3) where 1080 is the height, 1920 is the width and 3 is the number of channels (RGB).

        Example usage:
        - If the id of the camera2 is 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        camera2_id = 123
        frame = GetFrameFromCamera2.call(camera2_id=123)
        # assuming the frame is a numpy matrix
        print(frame.shape)  # (1080, 1920, 3)

        Things to keep in mind:
        - The refresh rate of the camera is 1 second, i.e. the frame is updated every second, so if the data service is called multiple times within a second, it will return the same value.
        - The frame is a numpy matrix, so avoid trying to access it as a dictionary. - input_parameters: ['camera2_id:int'] - output_values: ['frame:np.matrix'] - module: camera2 - class_name: GetFrameFromCamera2brief_description: Data service that, given a frame captured from a specific camera2 and the identifier of that camera2, detects whether the frame contains a stack of cardboards with errors. - detailed_description: Data service that, given a frame captured from a specific camera2 and the identifier of that camera2, detects whether the frame contains a stack of cardboards with errors.

        The data service relies on the management database of the cardboard factory to provide the list of diecutter id.
        The data service takes no parameter and returns a list of integers, which are the id of the diecutters installed in the factory.

        Example usage:
        - The data service would be called as follows:

        The data service relies on the management database of the cardboard factory to provide the session id.
        The data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the diecutter (an integer) and returns a single integer, which is the current session id of the diecutter.

        Example usage:
        - If the id of the diecutter is 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        diecutter_id = 123
        session_id = GetCurrentSessionIdFromDiecutterId.call(diecutter_id=123)

        In general each diecutter has exactly one chip embedded into it, and each chip is uniquely identified by an integer id. 
        This means that the chip id has a one-to-one correspondence with the id of the diecutter, but those two ids may not be the same.
        This data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the chip (an integer) and returns a single dictionary containing the current speed, temperature and number of rotations of the diecutter it is attached to.
        The keys of the dictionary are ""speed"", ""temperature"" and ""rotations"". 
        
        Example usage:
        - If the id of the chip is 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        chip_id = 123
        current_data = GetCurrentData.call(chip_id=123)
        # get the current speed, temperature and number of rotations
        current_speed = data[""speed""]
        current_temperature = data[""temperature""]
        current_rotations = data[""rotations""]
    
        Things to keep in mind:
        - The refresh rate of the data is 1 second, i.e. the data is updated every second, so if the data service is called multiple times within a second, it will return the same value.
        - Note that the values in the dictionary represents the current values of the speed, etc. of the diecutter, they are not aggregated values.
        - Remember that the output value is a dictionary with the above specified keys, so avoid trying to access it using keys not in the above example. - input_parameters: ['chip_id:int'] - output_values: ['diecutter_current_data:dict'] - module: diecutter - class_name: GetCurrentDataFromChip","from data_services.database import GetDiecutterChipIdFromDiecutterId

q1,8,Create a table displaying the highest speed of the diecutter identified by id 25 during a period of 30 seconds.,"brief_description: Data service that, given the id of a camera1, provides a frame captured from that camera1. - detailed_description: Data service that, given the id of a camera1, provides a frame captured from that camera1.
        In general instances of camera1 point downwards to a conveyor belt of a specific production line that trasports single cutout cardboards produced by a specific diecutter.
        The data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the camera1 (an integer) and returns a frame captured from that camera1 as a numpy matrix.
        The matrix is a 2D array having a shape of (1080, 1920, 3) where 1080 is the height, 1920 is the width and 3 is the number of channels (RGB).

        Example usage:
        - If the id of the camera1 is 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        camera1_id = 123
        frame = GetFrameFromCamera1.call(camera1_id=123)
        # assuming the frame is a numpy matrix
        print(frame.shape)  # (1080, 1920, 3)

        Things to keep in mind:
        - The refresh rate of the camera is 1 second, i.e. the frame is updated every second, so if the data service is called multiple times within a second, it will return the same value.
        - The frame is a numpy matrix, so avoid trying to access it as a dictionary. - input_parameters: ['camera1_id:int'] - output_values: ['frame:np.matrix'] - module: camera1 - class_name: GetFrameFromCamera1brief_description: Data service that, given a frame captured from a specific camera1 and the identifier of that camera1, detects whether the frame contains a cardboard with errors and provide the type of error. - detailed_description: Data service that, given a frame captured from a specific camera1 and the identifier of that camera1, detects whether the frame contains a cardboard with errors.
        Recall that a camera1 is a camera device that points downwards to a conveyor belt of a specific production line that trasports single cutout cardboards produced by a specific diecutter.
        It takes two parameters, the id of the camera1 to use and the frame captured from that camera1.
        It returns a boolean value, True if the frame contains a cardboard with errors, False otherwise.
        Also it returns a integer value, 0 if the frame does not contain errors, 1 if the errors are of type hole and 2 if the errors are of type fold. 

        Example usage:
        - If frame is a variable containing the frame captured from the camera1 with id 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        camera1_id = 123
        contains_errors, type_errors = DetectErrorsInCardboardUsingCamera1.call(camera1_id=123, frame=frame)

        Things to keep in mind:
        - The output is a tuple of boolean and integer, so avoid trying to access it as a dictionary. - input_parameters: ['camera1_id:int', 'frame:np.matrix'] - output_values: ['contains_errors:bool', 'error_type:int'] - module: camera1 - class_name: DetectErrorsInCardboardUsingCamera1brief_description: Data service that, given the id of a camera2, provides a frame captured from that camera2. - detailed_description: Data service that, given the id of a camera2, provides a frame captured from that camera2.
        Recall that a camera2 is a camera device that points downwards to a conveyor belt of a specific production line that trasports stack of cutout cardboards produced by a specific diecutter.
        The data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the camera2 (an integer) and returns a frame captured from that camera2 as a numpy matrix.
        The matrix is a 2D array having a shape of (1080, 1920, 3) where 1080 is the height, 1920 is the width and 3 is the number of channels (RGB).

        In general each diecutter has exactly one chip embedded into it, and each chip is uniquely identified by an integer id. 
        This means that the chip id has a one-to-one correspondence with the id of the diecutter, but those two ids may not be the same.
        This data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the chip (an integer) and returns a single dictionary containing the current speed, temperature and number of rotations of the diecutter it is attached to.
        The keys of the dictionary are ""speed"", ""temperature"" and ""rotations"". 
        
        Example usage:
        - If the id of the chip is 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        chip_id = 123
        current_data = GetCurrentData.call(chip_id=123)
        # get the current speed, temperature and number of rotations
        current_speed = data[""speed""]
        current_temperature = data[""temperature""]
        current_rotations = data[""rotations""]
    
        Things to keep in mind:
        - The refresh rate of the data is 1 second, i.e. the data is updated every second, so if the data service is called multiple times within a second, it will return the same value.
        - Note that the values in the dictionary represents the current values of the speed, etc. of the diecutter, they are not aggregated values.
        - Remember that the output value is a dictionary with the above specified keys, so avoid trying to access it using keys not in the above example. - input_parameters: ['chip_id:int'] - output_values: ['diecutter_current_data:dict'] - module: diecutter - class_name: GetCurrentDataFromChip","from data_services.database import GetDiecutterChipIdFromDiecutterId

q1,9,Create a table showing the maximum speed for the diecutter identified by ID 25 over a duration of 30 seconds.,"brief_description: Data service that, given the id of a camera1, provides a frame captured from that camera1. - detailed_description: Data service that, given the id of a camera1, provides a frame captured from that camera1.
        In general instances of camera1 point downwards to a conveyor belt of a specific production line that trasports single cutout cardboards produced by a specific diecutter.
        The data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the camera1 (an integer) and returns a frame captured from that camera1 as a numpy matrix.
        The matrix is a 2D array having a shape of (1080, 1920, 3) where 1080 is the height, 1920 is the width and 3 is the number of channels (RGB).

        Example usage:
        - If the id of the camera1 is 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        camera1_id = 123
        frame = GetFrameFromCamera1.call(camera1_id=123)
        # assuming the frame is a numpy matrix
        print(frame.shape)  # (1080, 1920, 3)

        Things to keep in mind:
        - The refresh rate of the camera is 1 second, i.e. the frame is updated every second, so if the data service is called multiple times within a second, it will return the same value.
        - The frame is a numpy matrix, so avoid trying to access it as a dictionary. - input_parameters: ['camera1_id:int'] - output_values: ['frame:np.matrix'] - module: camera1 - class_name: GetFrameFromCamera1brief_description: Data service that, given a frame captured from a specific camera1 and the identifier of that camera1, detects whether the frame contains a cardboard with errors and provide the type of error. - detailed_description: Data service that, given a frame captured from a specific camera1 and the identifier of that camera1, detects whether the frame contains a cardboard with errors.
        Recall that a camera1 is a camera device that points downwards to a conveyor belt of a specific production line that trasports single cutout cardboards produced by a specific diecutter.
        It takes two parameters, the id of the camera1 to use and the frame captured from that camera1.
        It returns a boolean value, True if the frame contains a cardboard with errors, False otherwise.
        Also it returns a integer value, 0 if the frame does not contain errors, 1 if the errors are of type hole and 2 if the errors are of type fold. 

        Example usage:
        - If frame is a variable containing the frame captured from the camera1 with id 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        camera1_id = 123
        contains_errors, type_errors = DetectErrorsInCardboardUsingCamera1.call(camera1_id=123, frame=frame)

        Things to keep in mind:
        - The output is a tuple of boolean and integer, so avoid trying to access it as a dictionary. - input_parameters: ['camera1_id:int', 'frame:np.matrix'] - output_values: ['contains_errors:bool', 'error_type:int'] - module: camera1 - class_name: DetectErrorsInCardboardUsingCamera1brief_description: Data service that, given the id of a camera2, provides a frame captured from that camera2. - detailed_description: Data service that, given the id of a camera2, provides a frame captured from that camera2.
        Recall that a camera2 is a camera device that points downwards to a conveyor belt of a specific production line that trasports stack of cutout cardboards produced by a specific diecutter.
        The data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the camera2 (an integer) and returns a frame captured from that camera2 as a numpy matrix.
        The matrix is a 2D array having a shape of (1080, 1920, 3) where 1080 is the height, 1920 is the width and 3 is the number of channels (RGB).

        The data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the diecutter (an integer) and returns a single integer, which is the current session id of the diecutter.

        Example usage:
        - If the id of the diecutter is 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        diecutter_id = 123
        session_id = GetCurrentSessionIdFromDiecutterId.call(diecutter_id=123)
        # assuming the session id is 456
        print(session_id)  # 456

        Things to keep in mind:
        - The session id is an integer, so avoid trying to access it as a dictionary. - input_parameters: ['diecutter_id:int'] - output_values: ['session_id:int'] - module: database - class_name: GetCurrentSessionIdFromDiecutterIdbrief_description: Data service that, given a chip id of a chip embedded into a diecutter, provides the current speed, temperature and number of rotations measured by that chip. - detailed_description: Data service that, given a chip id of a chip embedded into a diecutter, provides the current speed, temperature and number of rotations measured by that chip.
        In general each diecutter has exactly one chip embedded into it, and each chip is uniquely identified by an integer id. 
        This means that the chip id has a one-to-one correspondence with the id of the diecutter, but those two ids may not be the same.
        This data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the chip (an integer) and returns a single dictionary containing the current speed, temperature and number of rotations of the diecutter it is attached to.
        The keys of the dictionary are ""speed"", ""temperature"" and ""rotations"". 
        
        Example usage:
        - If the id of the chip is 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        chip_id = 123
        current_data = GetCurrentData.call(chip_id=123)
        # get the current speed, temperature and number of rotations
        current_speed = data[""speed""]
        current_temperature = data[""temperature""]
        current_rotations = data[""rotations""]
    
        Things to keep in mind:
        - The refresh rate of the data is 1 second, i.e. the data is updated every second, so if the data service is called multiple times within a second, it will return the same value.
        - Note that the values in the dictionary represents the current values of the speed, etc. of the diecutter, they are not aggregated values.
        - Remember that the output value is a dictionary with the above specified keys, so avoid trying to access it using keys not in the above example. - input_parameters: ['chip_id:int'] - output_values: ['diecutter_current_data:dict'] - module: diecutter - class_name: GetCurrentDataFromChip","from data_services.database import GetDiecutterChipIdFromDiecutterId

        In general each diecutter has exactly one chip embedded into it, and each chip is uniquely identified by an integer id. 
        This means that the chip id has a one-to-one correspondence with the id of the diecutter, but those two ids may not be the same.
        This data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the chip (an integer) and returns a single dictionary containing the current speed, temperature and number of rotations of the diecutter it is attached to.
        The keys of the dictionary are ""speed"", ""temperature"" and ""rotations"". 
        
        Example usage:

        chip_id = 123
        current_data = GetCurrentData.call(chip_id=123)

        current_rotations = data[""rotations""]
    
        Things to keep in mind:
        - The refresh rate of the data is 1 second, i.e. the data is updated every second, so if the data service is called multiple times within a second, it will return the same value.
        - Note that the values in the dictionary represents the current values of the speed, etc. of the diecutter, they are not aggregated values.
        - Remember that the output value is a dictionary with the above specified keys, so avoid trying to access it using keys not in the above example. - input_parameters: ['chip_id:int'] - output_values: ['diecutter_current_data:dict'] - module: diecutter - class_name: GetCurrentDataFromChip","from data_services.database import GetSerialCamera1IdFromDiecutterId, GetCurrentDataFromChip

        # assuming the session id is 456
        print(session_id)  # 456

        Things to keep in mind:
        - The session id is an integer, so avoid trying to access it as a dictionary. - input_parameters: ['diecutter_id:int'] - output_values: ['session_id:int'] - module: database - class_name: GetCurrentSessionIdFromDiecutterIdbrief_description: Data service that, given a chip id of a chip embedded into a diecutter, provides the current speed, temperature and number of rotations measured by that chip. - detailed_description: Data service that, given a chip id of a chip embedded into a diecutter, provides the current speed, temperature and number of rotations measured by that chip.
        In general each diecutter has exactly one chip embedded into it, and each chip is uniquely identified by an integer id. 
        This means that the chip id has a one-to-one correspondence with the id of the diecutter, but those two ids may not be the same.
        This data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the chip (an integer) and returns a single dictionary containing the current speed, temperature and number of rotations of the diecutter it is attached to.
        The keys of the dictionary are ""speed"", ""temperature"" and ""rotations"". 
        
        Example usage:
        - If the id of the chip is 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        chip_id = 123
        current_data = GetCurrentData.call(chip_id=123)
        # get the current speed, temperature and number of rotations
        current_speed = data[""speed""]
        current_temperature = data[""temperature""]
        current_rotations = data[""rotations""]
    
        Things to keep in mind:
        - The refresh rate of the data is 1 second, i.e. the data is updated every second, so if the data service is called multiple times within a second, it will return the same value.
        - Note that the values in the dictionary represents the current values of the speed, etc. of the diecutter, they are not aggregated values.
        - Remember that the output value is a dictionary with the above specified keys, so avoid trying to access it using keys not in the above example. - input_parameters: ['chip_id:int'] - output_values: ['diecutter_current_data:dict'] - module: diecutter - class_name: GetCurrentDataFromChip","from data_services.database import GetDiecutterChipIdFromDiecutterId

        The data service relies on the management database of the cardboard factory to provide the session id.
        The data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the diecutter (an integer) and returns a single integer, which is the current session id of the diecutter.

        Example usage:

        # assuming the session id is 456

        In general each diecutter has exactly one chip embedded into it, and each chip is uniquely identified by an integer id. 
        This means that the chip id has a one-to-one correspondence with the id of the diecutter, but those two ids may not be the same.
        This data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the chip (an integer) and returns a single dictionary containing the current speed, temperature and number of rotations of the diecutter it is attached to.
        The keys of the dictionary are ""speed"", ""temperature"" and ""rotations"". 
        
        Example usage:
        - If the id of the chip is 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        chip_id = 123
        current_data = GetCurrentData.call(chip_id=123)
        # get the current speed, temperature and number of rotations
        current_speed = data[""speed""]
        current_temperature = data[""temperature""]
        current_rotations = data[""rotations""]
    
        Things to keep in mind:
        - The refresh rate of the data is 1 second, i.e. the data is updated every second, so if the data service is called multiple times within a second, it will return the same value.
        - Note that the values in the dictionary represents the current values of the speed, etc. of the diecutter, they are not aggregated values.
        - Remember that the output value is a dictionary with the above specified keys, so avoid trying to access it using keys not in the above example. - input_parameters: ['chip_id:int'] - output_values: ['diecutter_current_data:dict'] - module: diecutter - class_name: GetCurrentDataFromChip","from data_services.database import GetDiecutterChipIdFromDiecutterId

        In general instances of camera1 point downwards to a conveyor belt of a specific production line that trasports single cutout cardboards produced by a specific diecutter.
        The data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the camera1 (an integer) and returns a frame captured from that camera1 as a numpy matrix.
        The matrix is a 2D array having a shape of (1080, 1920, 3) where 1080 is the height, 1920 is the width and 3 is the number of channels (RGB).

        Example usage:
        - If the id of the camera1 is 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        camera1_id = 123
        frame = GetFrameFromCamera1.call(camera1_id=123)
        # assuming the frame is a numpy matrix
        print(frame.shape)  # (1080, 1920, 3)

        Things to keep in mind:
        - The refresh rate of the camera is 1 second, i.e. the frame is updated every second, so if the data service is called multiple times within a second, it will return the same value.

        Recall that a camera1 is a camera device that points downwards to a conveyor belt of a specific production line that trasports single cutout cardboards produced by a specific diecutter.
        It takes two parameters, the id of the camera1 to use and the frame captured from that camera1.
        It returns a boolean value, True if the frame contains a cardboard with errors, False otherwise.
        Also it returns a integer value, 0 if the frame does not contain errors, 1 if the errors are of type hole and 2 if the errors are of type fold. 

        Example usage:
        - If frame is a variable containing the frame captured from the camera1 with id 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        camera1_id = 123
        contains_errors, type_errors = DetectErrorsInCardboardUsingCamera1.call(camera1_id=123, frame=frame)

        Things to keep in mind:

        The data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the camera2 (an integer) and returns a frame captured from that camera2 as a numpy matrix.
        The matrix is a 2D array having a shape of (1080, 1920, 3) where 1080 is the height, 1920 is the width and 3 is the number of channels (RGB).

        Example usage:
        - If the id of the camera2 is 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        camera2_id = 123
        frame = GetFrameFromCamera2.call(camera2_id=123)

        In general each diecutter has exactly one chip embedded into it, and each chip is uniquely identified by an integer id. 
        This means that the chip id has a one-to-one correspondence with the id of the diecutter, but those two ids may not be the same.
        This data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the chip (an integer) and returns a single dictionary containing the current speed, temperature and number of rotations of the diecutter it is attached to.
        The keys of the dictionary are ""speed"", ""temperature"" and ""rotations"". 
        
        Example usage:
        - If the id of the chip is 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        chip_id = 123
        current_data = GetCurrentData.call(chip_id=123)
        # get the current speed, temperature and number of rotations
        current_speed = data[""speed""]
        current_temperature = data[""temperature""]
        current_rotations = data[""rotations""]
    
        Things to keep in mind:
        - The refresh rate of the data is 1 second, i.e. the data is updated every second, so if the data service is called multiple times within a second, it will return the same value.
        - Note that the values in the dictionary represents the current values of the speed, etc. of the diecutter, they are not aggregated values.
        - Remember that the output value is a dictionary with the above specified keys, so avoid trying to access it using keys not in the above example. - input_parameters: ['chip_id:int'] - output_values: ['diecutter_current_data:dict'] - module: diecutter - class_name: GetCurrentDataFromChip","from data_services.database import GetDiecutterChipIdFromDiecutterId

        In general instances of camera1 point downwards to a conveyor belt of a specific production line that trasports single cutout cardboards produced by a specific diecutter.
        The data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the camera1 (an integer) and returns a frame captured from that camera1 as a numpy matrix.
        The matrix is a 2D array having a shape of (1080, 1920, 3) where 1080 is the height, 1920 is the width and 3 is the number of channels (RGB).

        Example usage:
        - If the id of the camera1 is 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        camera1_id = 123
        frame = GetFrameFromCamera1.call(camera1_id=123)
        # assuming the frame is a numpy matrix

        Things to keep in mind:
        - The refresh rate of the camera is 1 second, i.e. the frame is updated every second, so if the data service is called multiple times within a second, it will return the same value.

        Recall that a camera1 is a camera device that points downwards to a conveyor belt of a specific production line that trasports single cutout cardboards produced by a specific diecutter.
        It takes two parameters, the id of the camera1 to use and the frame captured from that camera1.
        It returns a boolean value, True if the frame contains a cardboard with errors, False otherwise.
        Also it returns a integer value, 0 if the frame does not contain errors, 1 if the errors are of type hole and 2 if the errors are of type fold. 

        Example usage:

        In general each diecutter has exactly one chip embedded into it, and each chip is uniquely identified by an integer id. 
        This means that the chip id has a one-to-one correspondence with the id of the diecutter, but those two ids may not be the same.
        This data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the chip (an integer) and returns a single dictionary containing the current speed, temperature and number of rotations of the diecutter it is attached to.
        The keys of the dictionary are ""speed"", ""temperature"" and ""rotations"". 
        
        Example usage:
        - If the id of the chip is 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        chip_id = 123
        current_data = GetCurrentData.call(chip_id=123)

        current_rotations = data[""rotations""]
    
        Things to keep in mind:
        - The refresh rate of the data is 1 second, i.e. the data is updated every second, so if the data service is called multiple times within a second, it will return the same value.
        - Note that the values in the dictionary represents the current values of the speed, etc. of the diecutter, they are not aggregated values.
        - Remember that the output value is a dictionary with the above specified keys, so avoid trying to access it using keys not in the above example. - input_parameters: ['chip_id:int'] - output_values: ['diecutter_current_data:dict'] - module: diecutter - class_name: GetCurrentDataFromChip","from data_services.database import GetDiecutterChipIdFromDiecutterId

q2,5,"Create a table of mean speeds for the ongoing session of diecutter 7, calculated across 10 successive, distinct time intervals of 10 seconds each.","brief_description: Data service that, given the id of a camera1, provides a frame captured from that camera1. - detailed_description: Data service that, given the id of a camera1, provides a frame captured from that camera1.
        In general instances of camera1 point downwards to a conveyor belt of a specific production line that trasports single cutout cardboards produced by a specific diecutter.
        The data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the camera1 (an integer) and returns a frame captured from that camera1 as a numpy matrix.
        The matrix is a 2D array having a shape of (1080, 1920, 3) where 1080 is the height, 1920 is the width and 3 is the number of channels (RGB).

        Example usage:
        - If the id of the camera1 is 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        camera1_id = 123
        frame = GetFrameFromCamera1.call(camera1_id=123)
        # assuming the frame is a numpy matrix
        print(frame.shape)  # (1080, 1920, 3)

        Things to keep in mind:
        - The refresh rate of the camera is 1 second, i.e. the frame is updated every second, so if the data service is called multiple times within a second, it will return the same value.
        - The frame is a numpy matrix, so avoid trying to access it as a dictionary. - input_parameters: ['camera1_id:int'] - output_values: ['frame:np.matrix'] - module: camera1 - class_name: GetFrameFromCamera1brief_description: Data service that, given a frame captured from a specific camera1 and the identifier of that camera1, detects whether the frame contains a cardboard with errors and provide the type of error. - detailed_description: Data service that, given a frame captured from a specific camera1 and the identifier of that camera1, detects whether the frame contains a cardboard with errors.
        Recall that a camera1 is a camera device that points downwards to a conveyor belt of a specific production line that trasports single cutout cardboards produced by a specific diecutter.
        It takes two parameters, the id of the camera1 to use and the frame captured from that camera1.
        It returns a boolean value, True if the frame contains a cardboard with errors, False otherwise.
        Also it returns a integer value, 0 if the frame does not contain errors, 1 if the errors are of type hole and 2 if the errors are of type fold. 

        Example usage:
        - If frame is a variable containing the frame captured from the camera1 with id 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        camera1_id = 123
        contains_errors, type_errors = DetectErrorsInCardboardUsingCamera1.call(camera1_id=123, frame=frame)

        The data service relies on the management database of the cardboard factory to provide the session id.
        The data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the diecutter (an integer) and returns a single integer, which is the current session id of the diecutter.

        Example usage:
        - If the id of the diecutter is 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        diecutter_id = 123
        session_id = GetCurrentSessionIdFromDiecutterId.call(diecutter_id=123)
        # assuming the session id is 456
        print(session_id)  # 456

        Things to keep in mind:
        - The session id is an integer, so avoid trying to access it as a dictionary. - input_parameters: ['diecutter_id:int'] - output_values: ['session_id:int'] - module: database - class_name: GetCurrentSessionIdFromDiecutterIdbrief_description: Data service that, given a chip id of a chip embedded into a diecutter, provides the current speed, temperature and number of rotations measured by that chip. - detailed_description: Data service that, given a chip id of a chip embedded into a diecutter, provides the current speed, temperature and number of rotations measured by that chip.
        In general each diecutter has exactly one chip embedded into it, and each chip is uniquely identified by an integer id. 
        This means that the chip id has a one-to-one correspondence with the id of the diecutter, but those two ids may not be the same.
        This data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the chip (an integer) and returns a single dictionary containing the current speed, temperature and number of rotations of the diecutter it is attached to.
        The keys of the dictionary are ""speed"", ""temperature"" and ""rotations"". 
        
        Example usage:
        - If the id of the chip is 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        chip_id = 123
        current_data = GetCurrentData.call(chip_id=123)
        # get the current speed, temperature and number of rotations
        current_speed = data[""speed""]
        current_temperature = data[""temperature""]
        current_rotations = data[""rotations""]
    
        Things to keep in mind:
        - The refresh rate of the data is 1 second, i.e. the data is updated every second, so if the data service is called multiple times within a second, it will return the same value.
        - Note that the values in the dictionary represents the current values of the speed, etc. of the diecutter, they are not aggregated values.
        - Remember that the output value is a dictionary with the above specified keys, so avoid trying to access it using keys not in the above example. - input_parameters: ['chip_id:int'] - output_values: ['diecutter_current_data:dict'] - module: diecutter - class_name: GetCurrentDataFromChip","from data_services.database import GetDiecutterChipIdFromDiecutterId

        The data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the diecutter (an integer) and returns a single integer, which is the current session id of the diecutter.

        Example usage:
        - If the id of the diecutter is 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        diecutter_id = 123
        session_id = GetCurrentSessionIdFromDiecutterId.call(diecutter_id=123)
        # assuming the session id is 456

        Things to keep in mind:

        In general each diecutter has exactly one chip embedded into it, and each chip is uniquely identified by an integer id. 
        This means that the chip id has a one-to-one correspondence with the id of the diecutter, but those two ids may not be the same.
        This data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the chip (an integer) and returns a single dictionary containing the current speed, temperature and number of rotations of the diecutter it is attached to.
        The keys of the dictionary are ""speed"", ""temperature"" and ""rotations"". 
        
        Example usage:
        - If the id of the chip is 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        chip_id = 123
        current_data = GetCurrentData.call(chip_id=123)
        # get the current speed, temperature and number of rotations
        current_speed = data[""speed""]
        current_temperature = data[""temperature""]
        current_rotations = data[""rotations""]
    
        Things to keep in mind:
        - The refresh rate of the data is 1 second, i.e. the data is updated every second, so if the data service is called multiple times within a second, it will return the same value.
        - Note that the values in the dictionary represents the current values of the speed, etc. of the diecutter, they are not aggregated values.
        - Remember that the output value is a dictionary with the above specified keys, so avoid trying to access it using keys not in the above example. - input_parameters: ['chip_id:int'] - output_values: ['diecutter_current_data:dict'] - module: diecutter - class_name: GetCurrentDataFromChip","from data_services.database import GetDiecutterChipIdFromDiecutterId

        In general instances of camera1 point downwards to a conveyor belt of a specific production line that trasports single cutout cardboards produced by a specific diecutter.
        The data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the camera1 (an integer) and returns a frame captured from that camera1 as a numpy matrix.
        The matrix is a 2D array having a shape of (1080, 1920, 3) where 1080 is the height, 1920 is the width and 3 is the number of channels (RGB).

        Example usage:
        - If the id of the camera1 is 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        camera1_id = 123

        In general each diecutter has exactly one chip embedded into it, and each chip is uniquely identified by an integer id. 
        This means that the chip id has a one-to-one correspondence with the id of the diecutter, but those two ids may not be the same.
        This data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the chip (an integer) and returns a single dictionary containing the current speed, temperature and number of rotations of the diecutter it is attached to.
        The keys of the dictionary are ""speed"", ""temperature"" and ""rotations"".

        - The refresh rate of the data is 1 second, i.e. the data is updated every second, so if the data service is called multiple times within a second, it will return the same value.
        - Note that the values in the dictionary represents the current values of the speed, etc. of the diecutter, they are not aggregated values.
        - Remember that the output value is a dictionary with the above specified keys, so avoid trying to access it using keys not in the above example. - input_parameters: ['chip_id:int'] - output_values: ['diecutter_current_data:dict'] - module: diecutter - class_name: GetCurrentDataFromChip","from data_services.database import GetSerialCamera1IdFromDiecutterId, GetCurrentDataFromChip

        - Note that the values in the dictionary represents the current values of the speed, etc. of the diecutter, they are not aggregated values.
        - Remember that the output value is a dictionary with the above specified keys, so avoid trying to access it using keys not in the above example. - input_parameters: ['chip_id:int'] - output_values: ['diecutter_current_data:dict'] - module: diecutter - class_name: GetCurrentDataFromChip","from data_services.database import GetSerialCamera1IdFromDiecutterId, GetCurrentDataFromChip

        This data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the chip (an integer) and returns a single dictionary containing the current speed, temperature and number of rotations of the diecutter it is attached to.
        The keys of the dictionary are ""speed"", ""temperature"" and ""rotations"". 
        
        Example usage:
        - If the id of the chip is 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        chip_id = 123
        current_data = GetCurrentData.call(chip_id=123)
        # get the current speed, temperature and number of rotations
        current_speed = data[""speed""]
        current_temperature = data[""temperature""]
        current_rotations = data[""rotations""]
    
        Things to keep in mind:
        - The refresh rate of the data is 1 second, i.e. the data is updated every second, so if the data service is called multiple times within a second, it will return the same value.
        - Note that the values in the dictionary represents the current values of the speed, etc. of the diecutter, they are not aggregated values.
        - Remember that the output value is a dictionary with the above specified keys, so avoid trying to access it using keys not in the above example. - input_parameters: ['chip_id:int'] - output_values: ['diecutter_current_data:dict'] - module: diecutter - class_name: GetCurrentDataFromChip","from data_services.database import GetDiecutterChipIdFromDiecutterId

        In general instances of camera1 point downwards to a conveyor belt of a specific production line that trasports single cutout cardboards produced by a specific diecutter.
        The data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the camera1 (an integer) and returns a frame captured from that camera1 as a numpy matrix.
        The matrix is a 2D array having a shape of (1080, 1920, 3) where 1080 is the height, 1920 is the width and 3 is the number of channels (RGB).

        Example usage:

        In general each diecutter has exactly one chip embedded into it, and each chip is uniquely identified by an integer id. 
        This means that the chip id has a one-to-one correspondence with the id of the diecutter, but those two ids may not be the same.
        This data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the chip (an integer) and returns a single dictionary containing the current speed, temperature and number of rotations of the diecutter it is attached to.
        The keys of the dictionary are ""speed"", ""temperature"" and ""rotations"".

        Things to keep in mind:
        - The refresh rate of the data is 1 second, i.e. the data is updated every second, so if the data service is called multiple times within a second, it will return the same value.
        - Note that the values in the dictionary represents the current values of the speed, etc. of the diecutter, they are not aggregated values.
        - Remember that the output value is a dictionary with the above specified keys, so avoid trying to access it using keys not in the above example. - input_parameters: ['chip_id:int'] - output_values: ['diecutter_current_data:dict'] - module: diecutter - class_name: GetCurrentDataFromChip","from data_services.database import GetSerialCamera1IdFromDiecutterId, GetSerialCamera2IdFromDiecutterId, GetDiecuttersIdOfFactory

        In general each diecutter has exactly one chip embedded into it, and each chip is uniquely identified by an integer id. 
        This means that the chip id has a one-to-one correspondence with the id of the diecutter, but those two ids may not be the same.
        This data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the chip (an integer) and returns a single dictionary containing the current speed, temperature and number of rotations of the diecutter it is attached to.
        The keys of the dictionary are ""speed"", ""temperature"" and ""rotations"". 
        
        Example usage:
        - If the id of the chip is 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        chip_id = 123
        current_data = GetCurrentData.call(chip_id=123)
        # get the current speed, temperature and number of rotations
        current_speed = data[""speed""]
        current_temperature = data[""temperature""]
        current_rotations = data[""rotations""]
    
        Things to keep in mind:
        - The refresh rate of the data is 1 second, i.e. the data is updated every second, so if the data service is called multiple times within a second, it will return the same value.
        - Note that the values in the dictionary represents the current values of the speed, etc. of the diecutter, they are not aggregated values.
        - Remember that the output value is a dictionary with the above specified keys, so avoid trying to access it using keys not in the above example. - input_parameters: ['chip_id:int'] - output_values: ['diecutter_current_data:dict'] - module: diecutter - class_name: GetCurrentDataFromChip","from data_services.database import GetSerialCamera1IdFromDiecutterId, GetSerialCamera2IdFromDiecutterId, GetDiecuttersIdOfFactory

        In general instances of camera1 point downwards to a conveyor belt of a specific production line that trasports single cutout cardboards produced by a specific diecutter.
        The data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the camera1 (an integer) and returns a frame captured from that camera1 as a numpy matrix.
        The matrix is a 2D array having a shape of (1080, 1920, 3) where 1080 is the height, 1920 is the width and 3 is the number of channels (RGB).

        Example usage:

        Recall that a camera1 is a camera device that points downwards to a conveyor belt of a specific production line that trasports single cutout cardboards produced by a specific diecutter.
        It takes two parameters, the id of the camera1 to use and the frame captured from that camera1.
        It returns a boolean value, True if the frame contains a cardboard with errors, False otherwise.
        Also it returns a integer value, 0 if the frame does not contain errors, 1 if the errors are of type hole and 2 if the errors are of type fold.

        In general each diecutter has exactly one chip embedded into it, and each chip is uniquely identified by an integer id. 
        This means that the chip id has a one-to-one correspondence with the id of the diecutter, but those two ids may not be the same.
        This data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the chip (an integer) and returns a single dictionary containing the current speed, temperature and number of rotations of the diecutter it is attached to.
        The keys of the dictionary are ""speed"", ""temperature"" and ""rotations"". 
        
        Example usage:

        In general instances of camera1 point downwards to a conveyor belt of a specific production line that trasports single cutout cardboards produced by a specific diecutter.
        The data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the camera1 (an integer) and returns a frame captured from that camera1 as a numpy matrix.
        The matrix is a 2D array having a shape of (1080, 1920, 3) where 1080 is the height, 1920 is the width and 3 is the number of channels (RGB).

        In general each diecutter has exactly one chip embedded into it, and each chip is uniquely identified by an integer id. 
        This means that the chip id has a one-to-one correspondence with the id of the diecutter, but those two ids may not be the same.
        This data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the chip (an integer) and returns a single dictionary containing the current speed, temperature and number of rotations of the diecutter it is attached to.
        The keys of the dictionary are ""speed"", ""temperature"" and ""rotations"". 
        
        Example usage:
        - If the id of the chip is 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        chip_id = 123
        current_data = GetCurrentData.call(chip_id=123)

        current_speed = data[""speed""]
        current_temperature = data[""temperature""]
        current_rotations = data[""rotations""]
    
        Things to keep in mind:
        - The refresh rate of the data is 1 second, i.e. the data is updated every second, so if the data service is called multiple times within a second, it will return the same value.
        - Note that the values in the dictionary represents the current values of the speed, etc. of the diecutter, they are not aggregated values.
        - Remember that the output value is a dictionary with the above specified keys, so avoid trying to access it using keys not in the above example. - input_parameters: ['chip_id:int'] - output_values: ['diecutter_current_data:dict'] - module: diecutter - class_name: GetCurrentDataFromChip","from data_services.database import GetSerialCamera1IdFromDiecutterId, GetSerialCamera2IdFromDiecutterId, GetDiecuttersIdOfFactory

        The data service relies on the management database of the cardboard factory to provide the session id.
        The data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the diecutter (an integer) and returns a single integer, which is the current session id of the diecutter.

        Example usage:
        - If the id of the diecutter is 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        diecutter_id = 123
        session_id = GetCurrentSessionIdFromDiecutterId.call(diecutter_id=123)
        # assuming the session id is 456

        In general each diecutter has exactly one chip embedded into it, and each chip is uniquely identified by an integer id. 
        This means that the chip id has a one-to-one correspondence with the id of the diecutter, but those two ids may not be the same.
        This data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the chip (an integer) and returns a single dictionary containing the current speed, temperature and number of rotations of the diecutter it is attached to.
        The keys of the dictionary are ""speed"", ""temperature"" and ""rotations"".

        In general instances of camera1 point downwards to a conveyor belt of a specific production line that trasports single cutout cardboards produced by a specific diecutter.
        The data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the camera1 (an integer) and returns a frame captured from that camera1 as a numpy matrix.
        The matrix is a 2D array having a shape of (1080, 1920, 3) where 1080 is the height, 1920 is the width and 3 is the number of channels (RGB).

        Example usage:

        In general each diecutter has exactly one chip embedded into it, and each chip is uniquely identified by an integer id. 
        This means that the chip id has a one-to-one correspondence with the id of the diecutter, but those two ids may not be the same.
        This data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the chip (an integer) and returns a single dictionary containing the current speed, temperature and number of rotations of the diecutter it is attached to.

        Things to keep in mind:
        - The refresh rate of the data is 1 second, i.e. the data is updated every second, so if the data service is called multiple times within a second, it will return the same value.
        - Note that the values in the dictionary represents the current values of the speed, etc. of the diecutter, they are not aggregated values.
