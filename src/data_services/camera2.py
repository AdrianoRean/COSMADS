        Recall that a camera2 is a camera device that points downwards to a conveyor belt of a specific production line that trasports stack of cutout cardboards produced by a specific diecutter.
        The data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the camera2 (an integer) and returns a frame captured from that camera2 as a numpy matrix.
        The matrix is a 2D array having a shape of (1080, 1920, 3) where 1080 is the height, 1920 is the width and 3 is the number of channels (RGB).

        Example usage:
        - If the id of the camera2 is 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        camera2_id = 123
        frame = GetFrameFromCamera2.call(camera2_id=123)
        # assuming the frame is a numpy matrix
        print(frame.shape)  # (1080, 1920, 3)

        Things to keep in mind:
        - The refresh rate of the camera is 1 second, i.e. the frame is updated every second, so if the data service is called multiple times within a second, it will return the same value.
        - The frame is a numpy matrix, so avoid trying to access it as a dictionary.""",
