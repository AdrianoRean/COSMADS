        In general instances of camera1 point downwards to a conveyor belt of a specific production line that trasports single cutout cardboards produced by a specific diecutter.
        The data service takes a single parameter, namely the id of the camera1 (an integer) and returns a frame captured from that camera1 as a numpy matrix.
        The matrix is a 2D array having a shape of (1080, 1920, 3) where 1080 is the height, 1920 is the width and 3 is the number of channels (RGB).

        Example usage:
        - If the id of the camera1 is 123, then the data service would be called as follows:
        camera1_id = 123
        frame = GetFrameFromCamera1.call(camera1_id=123)

        Recall that a camera1 is a camera device that points downwards to a conveyor belt of a specific production line that trasports single cutout cardboards produced by a specific diecutter.
        It takes two parameters, the id of the camera1 to use and the frame captured from that camera1.
        It returns a boolean value, True if the frame contains a cardboard with errors, False otherwise.
        Also it returns a integer value, 0 if the frame does not contain errors, 1 if the errors are of type hole and 2 if the errors are of type fold.
